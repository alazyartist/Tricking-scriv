            <Title>Special to Us</Title>
            <Text>It may even be more special to us because of the difficulty of explaining what this Tricking thing is all about to those who haven’t experienced it. There’s an element of it that gives us a sense of belonging to this secret club that only certain people are a member of and somehow we got invited. Much like the tight knit communities of skateboarding, surfing, rock climbing, snowboarding… pick any extreme sport, there is the crowd that “gets it” and the crowd that doesn’t, and much like many of those other extreme sports, Tricking too has some stigma attached with it from those who just do not understand what is taking place.  
This stigma comes from a misunderstanding. This misunderstanding of what is taking place happens because there is a consistent problem, on behalf of the participants, in not being able to convey the actuality of what’s taking place to those outside of the practice. Simple definitions are given without care and the “outsider” then takes those and makes their own assumptions without the proper context. 
It’s easy to misunderstand when each persons report on what Tricking is are largely subjective explanations. That’s why they typically default to a surface level answer that covers only a small portion of what it is. It is much easier for us to give fully, a partial picture than to give partially, a full picture, especially on demand.</Text>

            <Title>Terminology as a System</Title>
            <Text>	Try not to feel overwhelmed if you didn't retain much, or any of what we just went over. It was quite a lot to take in. It's more important that we start to recognize that this system is deeply integrated with its self and much of its complexity comes from simply putting two or more things together to create something new. We can then repeat this process, essentially ad infinitum.
	This synergistic generation opens us up to an inexhaustible amount of possibilities. It allows for something simple like a round kick and a hook kick to combine into something explosive and powerful like a JackKnife, or a Backflip to be manipulated into something such as a Boxcutter. And that Boxcutter to become a ShurikenCutter (CorkShurikenHyperHook). And That ShurikenCutter to become a Shurikane(CorkShurikenKyroHyperHook or put another way three outside kicks performed throughout a doublecork hyper). By understanding the framework that allows for this creation to take place we can partake in our own contribution to tricking. Exploring areas that we haven't seen others play with before. 
	Terminology isn't the only way we might understand this system. Many of the most talented trickers fall short when it comes to a deep dive on terminology. Which isn't to say they don't understand tricking. They most definitely do. They understand the unspoken side, the pure movement of it, what it feels like to be in a particular body position while moving through the air and how to manipulate that to achieve their goals. 
	This way of interacting with tricking by exploring the movements first and learning the terms as an aside can be very fruitful for some. While others might need to know what things are called and how to break them down in order to make any progress. Different approaches will appeal to different types of people who are trying to learn this thing.
	Either way of interacting with Tricking will effectively build up an understanding of the same system at its core. That is a system of movement potentials the human body has within it. One that is deeply complex and interwoven. And using the Tricking Terminology we have a decent way to accurately describe.

About This Template
When compiled (File &gt; Compile), this project will generate a document in standard manuscript format with sub-headings inside the chapters.

How To Use This Template
Edit the Title Page document to ensure it contains the correct information.
Create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, as chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter Subtitle”.
Create a new text document for each sub-section within the chapter folders, giving each the title of the subheading you wish to appear in the text. You can nest text documents for smaller subheadings, like this:
#
If you don’t require a foreword, move the “Foreword” document to the Trash folder. Alternatively, rename it “Preface” or “Introduction” if you prefer. If you would rather the foreword come after the table of contents—as is sometimes the case—drag the “Foreword” document and drop it below the “Contents” document.
If you are compiling to the RTF file format or if you have Microsoft Office installed and are compiling to DOC, DOCX, PDF or Print, you can create a table of contents. Before compiling, simply select all the documents you wish to be included in the contents listing (usually this will be the “Foreword”, all chapter folders, and “Endnotes”, but not the nested sub-sections), then go to Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as ToC. Paste into the “Contents” document below the “Contents” title. The resulting linked text and page number tags will be replaced with the final chapter names and page numbers in the compiled document. You can format the contents however you wish, for example removing the underlines or indenting subsections if you chose to include them. You don’t need to do this every time you compile, just when chapters have been added, deleted, renamed or moved around. (Note to Microsoft Word users: If you export to Word, you may need to generate a print preview in Word to force the page numbers to show up correctly—they may appear as question marks before doing so.) Deselect “Include in compile” for the Contents document in the inspector if you do not want it in your final output.
If you have no footnotes or endnotes in your text, be sure to delete the “Endnotes” document.
“Notes” and “Ideas” folders have been provided for your convenience, although you can replace them or create different top-level folders for your research materials if necessary (these are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)

Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to the settings to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
Chapter subtitles: If you don’t want to include the names of your chapter folders below the chapter numbering text in the compiled document, go to the “Formatting” pane in the Compile dialog and deselect “Title” in the list of elements to include. You will also need to edit the title prefix in the “Section Layout”.
Hierarchical numbering: If you require hierarchical numbering for sub-sections, choose “Non-Fiction with Sub-Heads (Hierarchical)” from the “Format As” menu in Compile. Alternatively, edit the “Section Layout” for each level in the “Formatting” pane of Compile and add the “&lt;$hn&gt;” (for “hierarchical numbering”) tag to the title prefixes. 
Page header: You can edit the page header in the “Page Settings” pane of the Compile dialog.
Font: You can use the “Formatting” pane in Compile to change the font used in the final document by selecting a row in the elements table, then clicking into the preview text to select it and clicking the “A” button in the format bar to change the font settings.

            <Title>Foreword</Title>
            <Text> It was December of 2010. I was sitting at the computer desk in our den (family living room) watching videos of people throwing their bodies into the air and contorting them in the wildest of ways before again landing upright on their feet. The activity I was watching was Tricking. This was a normal afternoon for me, get home from school and plop down at the computer to watch more of these insane movements, studying them, trying to understand just what was happening. On this particular afternoon my dad walks into the den and pauses over my shoulder to see what I’m doing. Noticing I’m watching more of those “flipping videos” he asks, “So, uhh… what’s the point here? How do you win?”	
“Well, that’s not really the point, you don’t really win, I mean you can… in these certain things we call battles, but those are just sort of thrown together at the Gatherings by either the hosts or just people that want to challenge each other for fun! You kind of win against yourself in way I guess just like doing new things.” 	
“So there aren’t any like organized competitions for money or leagues or anything like that?” He said looking visibly confused at what this thing is, and why his son had been obsessing about it for the last 8 months.	
“Not like the NBA or NFL or anything but it’s still really new and not that many people know about it but it is really growing fast! So, maybe we will see something like that one day. Who knows?” I said, trying to get him excited about the idea.	
“So then what’s this EPIC Gathering thing you are going to with Hunter next weekend? Is that not a competition? And if there isn’t a competition, again what’s the point. Why do you practice if you aren’t doing it to compete? For example, in gymnastics, or cheerleading, or football, or any other sport if you practice its so you can demonstrate those skills to show how you compare to the other people who also practice those skills, right? So if it’s a “sport” why would there be no competition?” He sighed not understanding.	
“It’s called a Gathering, its where a bunch of people who Trick come from all over the world to get together in a gym that someone rents out and we can Trick together and people share techniques and just hang out for the weekend. And like I said they have battles but they aren’t like “organized” by some agency or anything it’s just basically a bunch of people that like this thing that go to the same place to do the thing they like.” I replied, most likely visibly frustrated.	
“But I still don’t get the point of it, other than it’s just fun. I’m just trying to understand why it’s so important to you.”
I opened my mouth, then slowly shut it again. I didn’t quite have the right answer for the question he was actually trying to ask. I forget exactly how the conversation went on from there but I remember leaving it feeling frustrated like a typical teenager whose “parents just don’t understand”. In hindsight though I realize that my dad was genuinely trying to understand what it was that I was doing. More specifically what I was spending all of my time and money on. It was this conversation where the seed for this book was planted. Although I didn’t realize it at the time. 
My parent’s were always supportive of the things I did, including Tricking, but for some reason they just couldn’t wrap their heads around what Tricking actually was. And as it turns out, I wasn’t very good at explaining to them what it was in a way that they could understand. Some variation of this conversation of “what is it” and “what’s the point” would take place many times over the next few years as I became more and more active and involved with the community as a whole. 
Over the years a lot happened with Tricking and my life. In May of 2011, Rudy Meadows and I formed a company called Torque Tricking (on a whim the first time we hung out, but that’s a different story). We started going to every single event we could make it to. At one point when I counted it, we had been to 22 Tricking Gatherings in just under 2 years. It was around then that I stopped counting. After going to a quite a few from 2011-2012 we decided to have our own and fly out some Trickers for a little mini gathering. We called it TorqueMiniGathering. It was during an experience I had at this gathering that the seed for this book sprouted, and began to grow.
We were sitting in my living room talking about Tricking. To set the scene, I believe it was myself, Rudy Meadows, Hunter Mood, Kyle Butto, Alex Kerwood, Zach Kenney, Norman Storer, Tyler Wilson (A.K.A. Kite Tricking), Nick Vail, and Charlie Grenhart. My parents and siblings then joined the room and the conversation, at first listening and then beginning to ask the same old questions trying to grasp at why all this jumping around mattered so much to us. It was at this point when I watched as each of my friends struggled in exactly the same way as I did when trying to convey the power and importance this activity has to each of us. 
It was at that point, as I recall, that I began grappling with that question. I remember it eating away at me for weeks and weeks after that encounter (perhaps years). Why was it that we could talk to each other about this thing, in practically gibberish, and know that the other person was understanding exactly why we loved Tricking and why it was important to us; but for some reason, no matter what we tried, we could NOT explain it to someone who hadn’t experienced it in the way that we had. It was that problem that led me to asking many of the questions that I did over the last 8 years. And it is now after those 8 years that I feel I am ready to give it my best attempt in the following work to describe what Tricking is and why I let it take over my life and I do not regret a single second of it. 
I’m writing this for the Trickers struggling to explain to their friends and family that Tricking isn’t just play. I’m writing this for the family member who wants to know what their sibling/son/daughter is doing and why it could be one of the best things for them if fostered properly. My goal in writing this is to give in as much detail as I can an understanding of what Tricking is, why it matters, and hopefully give people a different appreciation for it. I hope you enjoy.

Thank You,

            <Title>Exploring the Movements</Title>
            <Text>That was a tough section we just went through where we covered quite a lot of information about Tricking. Hopefully by now we are starting to get a more decent picture of what these moves have evolved into. This is the system that would eventually build up over many months or years of attempting to learn individual tricks. Each trick giving us a new understanding of what possibilities are opened up through these movements.  
We can start taking these moves that have been laid out and using the system of stances and transitions to begin to create some combos. Linking together the Tricks that we have learned in as many ways as we can think of. We often start with two tricks that we want to connect. We then determine what type of transition we would like to use to get from one trick into the next. 
This aspect of tricking is when we start to explore the ways these movements are interacting with each other in ways that are more than theoretical. This takes us back into a similar encounter as we described in the Learning a Move section. One where we have to take our imagined version and bring it into reality by checking between the actual outcome and the desired outcome and making adjustment along the way. The process looking something like Attempt&gt;Assess&gt;Adjust. 
The attempt step is where we take our imagined version and try to map our actions to it as closely as we can. In this step we have made up our mind on what we are going to be trying with specific things we are going to keep in focus. The specific things often being the adjustments we’ve made in the past.
Then we can assess how our attempt measured up against our goal. It’s in this step that we reflect back upon the attempt and how it played out. Using as much information as we can about the situation by calling on all of our resources. Our proprioception, our peers, cameras, and of course the original model of the thing we are working towards. Through all of these feedback sources we can get a fairly good idea of where, how, and by how much we fell short from our goal. At which point we are prepared to get into the adjustment step. 
In the adjustment step we have weighed and measured our attempt against the goal and have gathered enough information to make informed changes to our approach. Updating the plan of action to be enacted in the next attempt. 
Each time we go through this we are not only learning things that are relevant to the specific Trick or combo we are in pursuit of. Many times our failures on the way to landing one Trick opens us up to new ways of doing other Tricks that we hadn’t explored before. We may not even realize that this is the case until we go to focus on those other Tricks. Each new skill we learn feeds into the overall understanding that we have of this system of movement as it unfolds in the physical world.
Tricking tends to show us that change is the primary constant when it comes to reality. Each time we try to do something, even if we have done it many times before. There will be some slight alterations to how it plays out. The speed, height, shape, fluidity, or maybe just the feeling. Some element will be different and require something different from us to succeed.
It’s this constant interpreting the implicit information that is shown by way of the explicit that builds up our diverse understandings of these movements in ways that we can know more about them their descriptions could ever afford us. Our descriptions can get us most of the way there, but there will always be something about the system that we won’t discover until we confront it firsthand in the movement.
It’s those subtle un-explainable features of each movement that separate those who truly understand them from those who know the theory. The skills that develop when you have mapped all of these minute understandings are what allow for a creativity to be brought forth.
We will quickly discover in our iteration over the attempts that each time we come back to the same movement some aspect will have changed. This is because each time we are doing it, it is different, and so are we.

            <Title>Setups</Title>
            <Text>SETUPS:
	Setups are movements we perform in order to generate momentum and get into the starting position for a particular trick. We have generally been referring to pure setups as opposed to setup tricks or setup combos. However colloquially you will hear the term setup used to refer to all three. Pure setups are the initial movements used to generate momentum and get into the starting position for the first Trick performed.
	These are the movements we use to get us from a standing unmoving position into one that is generating movement and momentum to be used in the upcoming Trick. The pure setups generally include J-Step, K-Step, Euro-Step, Pivot, back-step, Spin Step, Skip Step, as well as Standing. Each of these is used to position the body in a different way depending on which Trick you want to perform. Many of these are just slight variations of simmilar ways into the same Tricks. Typically only having slight alterations made between them it us up to the Tricker which ones feel the best for a particular Trick. 
 J-step, Euro-step, and Pivot for example are all ways to get into position where it is easy to perform a backswing. Standing, Skip-Step and Spin Step are common ways to get into position for a Bkick or Aerial style trick. This doesn't mean that someone couldn't do something like a spin-step into a backswing trick. They most certainly could.
	Any setup can be used to get into any trick you'd like, although its arguable that some are better suited for particular Tricks than others. That's the joy of Tricking though, you get to make it your own through the way you approach things. So whichever setups you'd like to incorporate. Have at it! It can be extremely fun to put tricks together with setups that are unconventional, it also helps us build an understanding of how momentum flows through the body during movements, making some tricks easier and others more difficult to perform based on the setup we chose. Finding the right setup to use is one that will only come through exploration of each of these, as well as creating your own. The setups we listed here are just the main few that are consistently used. 
	So the setups are what get us into the starting position of our first Trick. These are meant to work to our advantage in generating momentum to be used in execution of the Trick itself. This can make many tricks possible that (at first) could not easily be done from standing. We will be getting to the elements of the Tricks themselves in just a moment but first let's talk about how we &quot;Transition&quot; between two Tricks.</Text>

            <Title>Intro to Framework</Title>
            <Text>Intro To FRAMEWORK:
	We can start with the Anatomy of a Trick. This is a way of breaking down the Trick into more manageable chunks that contain useful information about the Trick. Having a way to label each of these sections allows for a deeper understanding of how Tricks are made up out of other elements. It also gives a structured way to play with new ideas by rearranging or variating their parts. 
***Insert Graphic Anatomy of a Trick***
	The Anatomy of a Trick, as seen above, has at it's heart the base-trick, referred to here as the core-trick, this is a set of movements that meets a particular criteria. The core-trick has an Entrance, Beginning, Middle, End, and an Exit. Each of these sections of the Trick offer up some information to be used in understanding the movement. The Entrance gives us information about the Takeoff Stance, and the Takeoff Style. The Entrance to the Trick is at the very start before any defining movements have been made that determine the core-trick being performed. The Beginning, Middle, and End, are the sections in which the core-trick is actually being performed in the air (or on the ground). The Exit of the Trick is after all essential movements for the Trick have been completed and the only thing left is to Land in a particular Landing Stance, and Landing Style for the next Transition. Each of these different sections can themselves be variated independently of the other elements of the Trick to create something different out of it. We will see how this works throughout this section. 
	All tricks have a directionality to them meaning they exist within an oriented framework where up and down and forward and backward have been decided by your Direction of Momentum. DOM, if you remember from earlier, simply means the direction we are traveling in space parallel to the ground, i.e. front to back, left to right, etc. Our DOM also gives a grounding point for the stances. The Stances are a way to refer to our bodies position in space in relation to our DOM. We have Takeoff Stances, as well as Landing Stances. The takeoff stance gives us information about the way the feet and body are positioned in relation to our DOM, in the entrance to the Trick, while the landing stance gives us information about the way the feet and body are positioned during the exit of the Trick. The Takeoff and Landing Styles denote how many feet, in what order, and in which way. We can usually find this information about the takeoff and landing styles by looking at the Transitions that are used in and out of the Trick. 
***Insert Graphic Anatomy of a Setup&gt;Trick***
	When a Trick is going to be performed the use a Setup of some kind is needed in order to generate the initial momentum. The setup can be thought to have the same anatomy as a Trick. The exit of the setup will overlap with the entrance of the Trick, this is where the performer is positioning themselves to begin the defining movement for the Trick. Taking that momentum that was generated and using it to perform the Trick. 
***Insert Graphic Anatomy of a Combo***	
	When tricks are performed in a combo a Transition of some form is used to move between the end state of one Trick and the Beginning state of another Trick. Transitions can be thought to have the same anatomy as the Tricks and Setups we've mentioned so far. And again like the shift from Setup to Trick the Exit of the Trick overlaps with the Entrance of the Transition. The Transitions main movements are performed and the Exit of the Transition overlaps with the Entrance to the next Trick. So the format is either Setup &gt; Trick or Setup &gt; Trick &gt; Transition &gt; Trick. Hopefully you are noticing the pattern that we can create by adding another &gt; Transition &gt; Trick to the end. We could do this &quot;theoretically&quot; forever.
	When we are chaining multiple Tricks together using various transitions we also have what we can refer to as our Momentum Line. This is effectively a trail of where in space we have been over the course of multiple Tricks. We could choose to maintain a linearity and keep each Trick going in the same direction even though we may incorporate a variety of Tricks. Alternatively we can allow, or even direct, our DOM to go in all sorts of directions. Some people will even spiral around the floor over the course of their combo. Using different transitions we can maintain or destroy our DOM(Direction of Movement) which could affect how much momentum we have to use in the next trick. 
	We can use this framework as the basic structure of Tricks and Tricking combos. Any trick we want to look at can be dissected, or created, through this lens. We have been talking about breaking things down into their parts quite a bit but these pieces aren't that useful when they aren't combined together. Its once we take these pieces and put them all back together that we actually start to get somewhere. We can take a Trick that we have broken down, make some adjustments to its pieces and put the new pieces back together. This gives us a different, and often more complex move. 
	All of the higher level Tricks are really just basic moves that were put through this process of variating the Core-trick over and over again until something new and interesting came out of it. This also means that if there is any higher level move that you want to perform you just have to work up the basic moves and do the small variations along the way to eventually get there. The whole tricking System is nothing more than a bunch of layers of simple movements that have been pushed to their limits!
	At this point we should have a basic understanding that Tricks can be looked at using the Anatomy of a Trick. That Tricks have setups, and transitions can be used to move from one Trick to the next. Tricking combos can be as long as the performer wants, or rather is capable of. And that all Tricks can be broken down into their more basic parts. We should also know that our Direction of Momentum is the grounding point for the stances; and that the stances reference our bodies position in relation to our DOM. 
	Next we can start to talk about the Parameters that can be used within this structure. We mentioned briefly the Stances, Setups and Transitions. We will also need to incorporate the flips, kicks, and rotations previously mentioned, and introduce grabs, touchdowns, and shapes. Once we have done this we will have the majority of movements we will need in order to create just about any Trick we can think of!</Text>

 Categorical breakdown only goes so far, the bleed between areas forces creative thinking to understand what is there. The theory to reality breakdown is evident. Re-framing of the problem is required and immediate. In the act new and creative solutions are discovered.</Text>

            <Title>Backflips and Mental Barriers</Title>
            <Text>	There will be some moves that will be arbitrarily difficult for us to do. Some element of it just doesn't click. Or worse, it does make sense but there is some breakdown between the theory and reality. We know exactly what to do but for some reason there is a blockade when we go to actually perform the action. We refer to these as mental barriers. This could be any move, and most all Trickers will encounter some form of this at some point in their Tricking career.  A mental barrier prevents us from trying something that we &quot;want&quot; to do. Learning flips, specifically the backflip is the first place many Trickers encounter this.
	In the case of the backflip, sometimes we don't even make it through the first attempt before having to confront this barrier. Something stops us from being able to complete the action that we have planned in our heads. We may even try to start the motions only to find ourselves beings stopped, by some other part of ourselves. This strange internal conflict starts bubbling up within us. We have a mental model of a backflip that we would like to perform, which informs us of the steps we need to execute in order to make that happen, and we have instructed our body to carry these actions out, however for some reason just as we are about to execute one of the steps all of our muscles defy us and freeze, stopping us from doing it. This is our fear getting the better of us. Some part of us that we haven't acknowledged is anticipating some outcome that does not end favorably for us and our survival instincts are kicking in. 
	The problem isn't that the fear exists, the problem is that we are letting the fear hijack our ability to act. We let ourselves get caught in the loop of thinking, and over-thinkning the situation. Our attention is turned fully towards the list of actions and how we will do them improperly and hurt ourselves. Caught in this loop we will not be able to act at all. We have to break our attention away from the mental world of possibilities and potentials, the world of what-if's and could-be's. And instead turn our attention to the real world, to our physical body and how we control it's actions.
	We have to allow our attention to be so fully focused on the present moment. In a way that each moment as it passes is leaving no trace behind, and each future moment not even yet a conception, so that no fear can get in between our will and our actions. Even the plan, the list of steps we need to do to perform the trick, is forgotten. The only thing that matters is doing it. We only focus on the action as it is needed, and not before. Each one coming naturally as the movement unfolds. This is obviously easier described like this in hindsight, after having gone through this process many times. 
	In reality it feels a bit more like screaming and hucking the movement as it rushes by in a flash of disorientation. The only thing we really remember from it is that it happened, and we made ourselves break through that barrier that had kept us from doing it before. There is no simple way to get through this barrier. We may take various approaches to work around this &quot;action-stopping&quot; fear. Attempting to get over the it by working on tricks that if we slowly make manipulations to them will turn into the desired trick.
	For instance starting with a Tornado kick and slowly turning that into a Raiz by inverting it little by little, or taking a swing hook and slowly inverting it into a slant gainer and eventually just a gainer. &quot;Cheating&quot; our way up to more difficult moves can sometimes work for us to overcome mental barriers. However there are some that can't be worked around and must simply be gone through. Things like the backflip. Just your basic standing backtuck. There is no special cheat-code for this one. You just have to make your body overcome the fears. 
	I've found that it seems to come down to a trust you need to have in yourself. A willingness to accept no version of reality but the one containing success and to completely dispel with any other &quot;what-ifs&quot; and &quot;could-bes&quot;. There is only one outcome and that is success. If you let doubt in you will hit that barrier. Once you've gathered the trust and are visualizing the outcome, you just act focusing only on acting and nothing else. If you let your focus shift, you will fail. If however you maintain that focus it will unfold and you will have broken the mental barrier. We can now get back to our cycle of improvement through Attempt, Assess, Adjust. Something we were not able to do when we couldn't even attempt the Trick. 
	There really is no magic trick to getting through those difficult blockades that we will all encounter at some point or another. It comes down to developing an understanding, a trust, and an ability to act. These things only develop over time and practice within the individual continually dealing with these problems. It's the iterations of us working to overcome these mental barriers that build our resolve. It's difficult for us to fail before we've even begun the attempt, but a willingness to overcome that, even if it takes years, is something that no one will be able to take away from us. We will always know that if we keep at something for long enough we will overcome any barrier that stands in our way. Even if that barrier is our self. Which pro-tip. It usually is.  </Text>

            <Title>TrickTheory Glossary</Title>
            <Text> 	•	Aeriform (Aeriformmat.com):  The main site for TKT users.  Aeriform could also be said to be a system of understanding, learning, and teaching, and is the basis for many of the concepts and definitions in Tricktheory because of it standardization and uniformity from user to user.Ambi:  Short for ambidextrous. This generally refers to ability to perform a given trick on both sides, but can also mean the ability to do a trick on the opposite side, also known as the darkside, onlyBackswing:  takeoff in which the performer’s leg travels from back to front in a pendulum motion, similarly to kicking a ball. This is typically used to initiate back flipping motions such as gainers and corks.Backside: a stance in which the performer’s chest is turned 90 degrees from the target, and their outside kicking leg is nearest the target. Generally, this means that you face away from your momentum while comboing. Simply stated, the performer’s back faces the way they travel.Blocking: a term used to describe the transfer of linear momentum into vertical lift.Â  In many cases, the mission of the block is to translate all of the momentum into lift, thereby stopping travel in favor of greater height.Boneless:  a description of the type of vanish pplied when transitioning from a hyper landing into a cork without changing the line of momentum.Â  (Advanced)Bound:  The secondary form of all Unified transitions.  bound follows the pattern of a unified transition, but has an extra adjustment step between the landing and takeoff. (Beginner / dvanced)Carrythrough:  The secondary form of the swingthrough transition.  carrythrough is any swingthrough performed with an extra pivot, or stance change.  For many, this is synonymous with a frontswing, though this has been largely discredited. (Beginner / advanced)Chamber: The act of preparing a kick before execution. This is generally seen as lifting the knee before the extension.Cheat (Takeoff):   method of takeoff where the performer lifts their outside kicking leg while pivoting up to 180 degrees in the direction of their typical rotation, and somewhat emulates a spinning hook kick. This takeoff can be performed from either backside or frontside stances, but is most commonly seen starting in frontside. This takeoff is commonly referred to as a wraptakeoff when performed from a backside stance.Crowd Awakener (CA):   side split, or straddled variation in which two inverted round kicks are performed In practice however, most circumstances where a wide straddle is achieved will still bare the name, regardless of actual kicks performed.Combo:  Multiple tricks or movements completed in succession.Complete (Stance): The most common landing position from the invert axis that typically lands on the performer’s outside kicking leg, with the performerâ€™s momentum pulling backward. Â This stance allows the performer to typically swing through into a backswing motion. Â This is the marker at which twisting tricks are measured as single, double, triple, etc. and is almost never named.Â  (Beginner / dvanced)Cutter:   nod to the Boxcutter, this suffix is generally used on an inverted axis in place of the term Hyper-Hook, and can be considered slang.
Cyclone:   term used almost exclusively in TKT, it is aÂ variationÂ where the performer executes an outside kick followed by 360 degrees of rotation (Hyper + Half Gyro), and another outside kick. Â In mainstream terminology, a cyclone is a â€œdoubleâ€� kickingÂ variationÂ with hook kicks.
Darkside: The opposite side, or doing a trick with the opposite direction of spin from normal. Â It is somewhat uncommon for trickers to utilize both sides, or directions of spin, so tricks done on the non-dominant orientation are referred to as being darksided.
Double Leg (Dleg): Â Both a unique trick and aÂ variationÂ type, or position in the air, it is modeled after the Armada Dupla from capoeira, and can be described as gymnastics pike position while twisting.
Double (Kicking): Â ThisÂ variationÂ is most often associated with any kick followed by 360 degrees of rotation (Hyper + Half Gyro) and another of the same kick.  nother more rare variation has two of the same kick on a target with no rotation performed between them. Â Technically, anytime two kicks are delivered in-air it can be called a double, but there is usually a more appropriate suffix to use. Â In mainstream terminology, the name of the trick begins with the highest rotation and ends with the â€⃜doubleâ€™ suffix. Â For example:  pop-720-double.
Double (Twisting):  ny inverted trick with two twists around the vertical axis ending at the complete landing position.
Dub:Â   slang term for a double twist. Â Occasionally this term will be thrown around for vert kicks as well, but its most common usage refers to inverted tricks.
Eagle:Â   slang term for the starting position utilized for backswings. Â It is characterized by the swing leg lifted behind the body and the arms back.
Envergado:Â   fully inverted parafuso.  nother way to look at this trick is as an inverted raiz into a double leg. Â The â€⃜enverâ€™ prefix can be used to note an envergado followed by aÂ variationÂ suffix, such as enver-snapu:  nd envergado followed by a full twist.	•	
Fake (Landing Stances):Â  Terms coined by Ben Atkins to describe an atypical landing position.Â  (Discussed Here)
Fei Long:  n in-air kicking combination in which an outside kick is followed by 180 degrees of rotation and an inside kick to the same target. Â Generally this is done with crescent kicks, as they allow the hips to stay open and more freely execute both kicks. Â This is both a specific vert kick, as well as a variation type on both the vertical and inverted axis.Â  (VertÂ /Â Invert)
Fei Long Cross:   specific variation of the Fei Long in which a hook and round are used.
Feint:Â   faked kick. Most often, this means a vert kick is performed and the kick is only chambered, but never extended. The term â€⃜Fakeâ€™ is often used to mean the same thing.
Feiwrong:   suffix used almost exclusively in TKT to note a true-hyper outside kick landing in a backside stance.
Flagella:Â  n old slang term for a round kick followed by a missleg transition into a btwist or aerial.Â  Contemporary wisdom argues this transition is actually a swingthrough that utilizes a frontswing, and not a missleg as it has been traditionally understood to be.
Flamingo: Â Similar to the â€⃜eagleâ€™ position, but in reverse. Â The flamingo is the starting position for a frontswing and is characterized by the swinging leg extended in front of the body and the arms raised up, ready to be swung backward.
Gainer: Â Unlike traditional gymnastics, the tricking gainer does not require forward motion. Â It is simply a backflip performed from one leg, generally from a swing takeoff. Â This term is often used casually to refer to both the gainer-flash kick, and the gainer-switch, allowing for context to imply which is being used. Â The gainer prefix is usually used to note a swing takeoff into an inverted trick.
GC:  Generic Combo. Â This is a relatively uncommon term that came about in reply to the prevalent use of the â€⃜OCâ€™, or Original Combo, term to describe combos that lack any real imagination or creativity. Â Simply put, GCâ€™s have been done so often by so many people that they are almost compulsory routines.
Grab: Â Similar to board sports, it is simply the act of grabbing a part of the body, generally the leg or feet, with the hand.
Grandmaster:Â   trick performed from a master swing where the hands do not touch the ground. Â For example, a masterswipe without landing on the hands becomes a grandmasterswipe.
Gyro: Â Both a specific and general term for an addedÂ 360 degree spinÂ or twist after a kick. Â Gyro is generally used for vertical tricks, and implies that the extra rotation occurs with the performer upright, after a hyper. Â It is not uncommon for some people to also use the gyro tag to describe a vertical twistÂ on the way downÂ from inverted tricks as well. Â Within the vert kicking realm, Gyro can also be divided into Half-Gyro, for 180 degree rotations after a hyper. Â Many mainstream (terminology) users do not use specific rotational degrees, nor the term Half-Gyro, allowing any substantial rotation near 360 degrees post-kick to bare the Gyro suffix.  mong TKT users, a true hyper-gyro is 540 degrees of rotation after a kick (180 for the hyper + 360 for the gyro).
Gyroknife:Â   specific trick, and a type ofÂ variationÂ on the knife pattern, gyroknifes have an entire 540 degrees of rotation (Hyper + Gyro) between the inside kick and outside kick, rather than the standard 180 degrees.
Half-Gyro: Â See Gyro. An additionalÂ 180 degreesÂ of rotation after a hyper.
Hawkeye:   variation in which any inside kick is replaced with a hook kick. This is often looked at as a darkside hook kick because the leg performing it is usually used exclusively for inside kicking.
Hook Kick:Â   traditional martial arts hook kick. Â There are many ways to perform this kick, but the general guideline is that the foot is turned horizontally upon striking its target. Â The contact point, traditionally, is the heel of the foot. Â This is often done by using the back of the heel, just below the achilles tendon.  nother way is to point the toe, and strike with either the bottom of the heel, or the entire bottom of the foot. Â Trickers often adopt the pointed toe to add length and greater aesthetic value.
Hyper (General):  Originally, hyper was used to note the over-rotation of a trick, and landing on the opposite foot. Â While this understanding still persists, it is widely becoming understood to be more specific than this, and further disambiguated.
Hyper (Stance):Â   landing position on the invert axis where the performer rotates past the complete position, and lands on their inside kicking leg, with the performerâ€™s momentum pulling backward or toward their inside flipping shoulder. Â This position typically allows the performer to wrapthrough, orÂ swingthrough into masterswings.Â  (BeginnerÂ / dvanced)
Hyper (Vert):Â  This generally means toÂ land on the kicking leg. Â In the TKT system, this term is specifically a 180 degree rotation after a kick, landing on both feet simultaneously. Â This term can also be, and often is, used as a blanket term, allowing the following transitional tag to express the difference between a Hyper (TKT) landing, and a True-Hyper landing.
Hyper-Hook:  variationÂ used on the invert axis, this suffix means that the trick was taken to the hyper landing, and an additional hook kick was executed before landing. Â This term is occasionally used similarly in vert kicking, but is generally a misnomer, as other suffixes generally apply better. Â Hyperhook is also a proper name for a Btwist Hyper-Hook.
Hyper-Style (Vert):  landingÂ in which 180 degrees of rotation is performed after a vertical kick, but the non-kicking landing leg is still used. Â This is a term used mostly within TKT, and rarely heard in mainstream terminology.
Inside Crescent Kick:  Similar to the round kick, but generally done with a straight leg. Â The key difference is that the foot stays vertical throughout this kick, and strikes with the inside edge, and arch of the foot.
Inside Flip:   term used almost exclusively in TKT, the inside flip is a side flip toward the direction the performer twists, and is often performed from an inside stance.   right twister would inside flip over their right shoulder. Â The inside flip is considered the base flip for the Tak axis, as well as the master swing.
Inside Kick:Â   generic term usually referring to either a round, or inside crescent kick.
Inside Stance:   stance between frontside and backside where the performerâ€™s hips face squarely toward the target. Â It is not uncommon for some trickers to adopt the inside stance as their backside stance, and is commonly accepted as such in combos.
Invert:  The act of flipping within a trick. Â In order to be a true inverted trick, the hips must reach a point higher than the performerâ€™s head during the trick. Â In general, tricks reaching approximately horizontal orientation, or where the hips are level with the performerâ€™s head, are often considered inverted tricks.
Jackknife:  nÂ in-air kicking combinationÂ in which an inside kick is followed by 180 degrees of rotation and an outside kick to the same target. Â Generally this is done with a round kick followed by a hook kick. Â The round is often preferred because it more freely snaps the hips over, allowing the hook to follow.
J Step:Â   common setup used for swinging tricks. Â The performer steps for ward with a variable number of steps, usually two.  s they step with their final step onto the outside leg, the foot is turned 90 degrees outward, and the trailing leg is swung through. Â The turn creates a â€⃜Jâ€™ pattern on the ground, and initiates a torque in the hips as they turn to square themselves, increasingÂ power on the swing.
Jujimufu (Juji):Â  The owner and operator of Trickstutorials, an early and extremely influential tricking website.Â  Trickstutorials is arguably the most influential tricking site ever, and can credited with birthing, or at least fostering, the early careers of many of the greatest trickers of all time.
Katana (Vert):  Â True-HyperÂ inside kick. Â This term is used almost exclusively in TKT communities and is almost never used by mainstream users.
Knife:Â  See Jackknife, and Swipe Knife.Â  ThisÂ suffixÂ is generally added to both inverted tricks and vertical kicks, and implies either a hypered inside kick or swipe was performed at some point, and that the trick will land with an additional hook.
Kyro: ny hyper-hook followed by an additional twist or gyro. In terms of the use of thisÂ suffix, the hyper-hook is implied and should not be named. For example:  boxcutter-twist = cork kyro, not boxcutter-kyro.
K Step:Â   term generally used to describe a variation of the cheat takeoff where a slight stutter, or double pivot, is created on the base leg. Â This form of the cheat takeoff is popular among the Korean trickers and as such was dubbed the â€⃜K stepâ€™, or â€⃜Korean Stepâ€™.
Landing Stance:  The position in which a trick terminates. Â For bothÂ vertical and invertedÂ tricks there are a multitude of possible positions, each carrying their own transitional possibilities.
Late- : Â variationÂ usually followed by a number implying a kick type in mainstream terminology, this is characterized by large over rotation on the invert axis, ending in either mega with an inside kick, or more rarely by changing axis to twist vertically into n outside kick. Â The numeric value assigned to the â€œlateâ€� tag corresponds to vertical backside kick using mainstream terminology. Â This means that single-mega skills are assigned the title â€œLate9â€�, â€œLate 900â€�, or â€œLate-roundâ€� because their total rotation, not counting the flip, approximately corresponds to the backside900.  €œLateâ€� hook tricks will use the corresponding hook vert kick numbers, such as 720 or 1080.

Mainstream (Terminology): Â The most common language and set of terms used by trickers.Â  Many of the names date back to the origins of tricking and sport karate circuits of the 1990â€™s. Â Mainstream terminology is more or less an oral tradition. Â Many definitions and concepts can be deduced from common usage and older sites, but there is no central location or formal standardization. Â It is a loose system with varying perspectives and opinions.

Master:  lso referred to as a masterswing, is aÂ swing takeoff where the performerâ€™s leading leg is elevated and swings inward, closing the legs and initiating an inside flip. Â Tricks involving a master swing tend to bare the prefix â€⃜masterâ€™, or â€⃜grandmasterâ€™. Â The difference between the master and grandmaster is simply whether or not the performerâ€™s hands touch during the trick. Â In a master- trick, the performer will land on their hands before finishing the trick, where a grandmaster trick is completed entirely in the air.

Mega (Stance):Â   landing position on the invert axis where the performer rotates past the hyper position and lands on the outside kicking leg, with their momentum pulling them forward or toward their inside flipping shoulder. Â This stance is 180 degrees past the complete landing stance, and can be looked at as a half rotation. Â Mega landings allow the performer to swingthrough into frontswing, aerial, and btwist axis tricks.Â  (BasicÂ / dvanced)
Mega-Round:  See Late-.  Â suffixÂ used to describe landing a trick in the mega position with a round kick. Â This is more commonly referred to as a â€⃜Lateâ€™ round.

Missleg:  singular transition in which the in-air leg rebounds into the next trick.Â  It could be said that the leg literally misses the ground, and changes its path to create takeoff.Â  (BasicÂ / dvanced)
Momentum Line:Â  The imaginary line created by a tricker as they travel during a combo. Â The momentum line is generally perpendicular to the target both in practice and in theory. Â Using the cardinal directions of a compass, if the target is designated as North, the momentum line will generally be described as East to West for leftÂ twisters, or West to East for rightÂ twisters.

Murder:  name describing a swingthrough where the swinging leg was grabbed in the previous trick, and held throughout the transition.Â  For example, when doing a cork-rodeo, landed holding the rodeo grab, and swung into another cork, the second cork would be described as a murder cork.

NASKA:  The North American Sport Karate Association. Â NASKA is one of the oldest, most prestigious sport karate leagues, and is one of the birth places of many of the tricks found in tricking today, as well as its early practitioners.
OC:  Original Combo. Â The â€⃜OCâ€™ is a slang term used to note any combo with a particularly high degree of originality, creativity, and often technicality.
Outside Crescent Kick:Â  Similar to the hook kick, but generally done with a straight leg. The key difference is that the foot stays vertical, or toes facing up, throughout this kick, and strikes with the outside edge of the foot, also known as the blade of the foot.
Outside Flip:Â   term used almost exclusively in TKT, the outside flip is a side flip in the opposite direction of the performerâ€™s twisting direction, and is performed from an outside stance.   right twister would flip over their left shoulder. Â The outside flip is considered the base flip for the raiz axis.
Outside Kick:Â   generic term usually referring to either a hook, or outside crescent kick.
Outside Stance:Â   stance between backside and frontside where the performerâ€™s hips face away from the target. Â It is very common to see trickers adopt the outside stance as their frontside stance, particularly when taking off for vert kicks.	•	
Parafuso (Para-):  nother form of theÂ double leg, the parafuso can be described as a cheat takeoff into a double leg where the legs come together on the target. Â It is not uncommon to see â€⃜paraâ€™ used as a prefix to describe any double leg variation on both the vertical and inverted axis.  rguably this can become a misnomer, but it is generally acceptable to do so.
Peter Pan:   variation, or position taken during a trick, in which the performer places both fists on their hips, with their elbows wide, similar to the stance taken by Peter Pan in the animated Disney movie.
Pizzaboy:  Â variationÂ similar to a scissor or helicoptero, Pizzaboys have been described as a â€œflashkick swing tornado kickâ€� in the air before landing.Â  The pizzaboy completes the flashkick or swipe before transitioning to the tornado, and can be added to any move with a swipe or flash kick motion. nother way to describe it is that it is a swipe or flash followed by a late/mega-round.
Pop:Â   method of takeoff where the performer jumps with both feet simultaneously, and can be performed from either frontside or backside stances. Â Pop is also the name of a transitionÂ where a sequential landing is followed by a unified landing. Â Simply put, a pop transition is landing on one foot, then the next, but taking off into the next trick with both feet at the same time.Â  ( Transition:  BasicÂ / dvanced)
Pump:Â   term used to describe the lifting of the knee, as if chambering, during the rotation of vert kick. Â This usually means the non-kicking leg will be pumped prior to extending the kick with the opposite leg, and can be used as a precursor to a multi-kick variation.
Punch:  unified transition that connects a unified landing to a unified takeoff.Â  For most trickers, this is synonymous with a powerful stomp into the ground to create rebound.Â  (BasicÂ / dvanced)
Rapid:Â  The secondary form of the missleg transition.Â  This is most easily understood to be a one legged punch.Â  (BasicÂ / dvanced)
Rechamber:  The act of bending the knee after a kick has been performed. Â This allows greater control upon landing as well as the ability to kick again more efficiently and powerfully.
Recycle:  slang term for a master swing, typically from a hook kick, into a vert kick.Â  Essentially, this allows swings into backside kicks without the need to pivot.
Redirect:  The secondary form of a reversal transition.Â  Redirect transitions land sequentially, followed by an adjustment step, and takeoff in the reverse sequence from their landing.Â  (BasicÂ / dvanced)
Reversal:  sequential transition where the sequence of landing and takeoff are reversed.Â  (BasicÂ / dvanced)
Reverse: n older term used to describe traveling backward into a trick, or a trick that doesnâ€™t usually have backward travel performed with it.Â  This term is largely forgotten and is often instead used to describe a reversal transition.
Reverse Pop:  unified transition that follows the reversed sequence of a pop transition.Â  Reverse pops are a unified landing followed by a sequential takeoff.Â  (BasicÂ / dvanced)
Rocket Boy:   distinct trick as well asÂ position, orÂ variation, where the performer reaches down in a piked position and grabs the opposite ankle with their hand while the other arm reaches high above the head during an inverted trick.
Rodeo:   position in which the performer reaches back and grabs their ankle. This is generally accompanied by pushing forward with the hips and arching the back to further emphasize the position.
Round Kick:   traditional martial arts roundhouse kick. Â There are many ways to perform this kick, but the general guideline is that the foot is turned horizontally upon striking its target. Â The contact point, traditionally, is the ball of the foot, or with a pointed toe is anywhere from the top of the foot to the middle of the shin. Â It is common for trickers to use a pointed toe for this kick to add length and greater aesthetic value.
-Round (Variation):  variationÂ where a complete rotation is made on the invert axis, followed by a round kick to target. Â For example, a cork ending in a round kick is called a cork-round.
Safari:Â  See Rocket Boy.Â  Similar to the Rocket Boy, but utilizing a shuriken (variation), rather than a pike, or double leg.Â  The arm opposite from the kicking leg should make the grab to create the proper twisted position.
Scissor:Â   slang term forÂ scissorswipe, but arguably less ambiguous. Â This term is quickly taking the place of Scissorswipe within the community.Â  Scissors are twist kicks, or â€œinside roundâ€� kicks performed with the inside kicking leg, and typically land mega.
Scissorswipe:  variationÂ on the martial arts scissor kick in which an outside kick or side kick is performed simultaneously with an inverted round kick, or twist kick, with the other leg. This variation is most often applied to invert tricks. Within the tricking community, the only emphasis is on the twist kick, or inverted round. Â There is a growing movement to drop the â€⃜swipeâ€™ from this name as there is no traditional â€⃜swipeâ€™ involved.

Seagull:  Similar to the Eagle and Flamingo positions, this is the slang term for the starting position of the master swing.
Semi- (Stance):   landing position on the invert axis where the performer rotates past the mega position and lands on the inside kicking leg, with their momentum pulling them forward or toward their outside flipping shoulder. Â This stance is 180 degrees past the hyper position, and can be looked at as a half rotation. Â Semi landings allow the performer to swingthrough into frontswing, raiz axis tricks.Â  (BasicÂ / dvanced)
Sequential:Â  This term describes a landing or takeoff where the feet land one at a time.Â  When used to describe transitions, it means that both the landing and takeoff occurs one foot at a time.
Shuriken (Variation):  Â variationÂ type on the invert axis where an outside kick is performed while twisting, followed by landing on the kicking leg in the complete stance.  t higher rotations, further twisting can be performed after the kick and still retain the shuriken tag.
Shuriken (Vert):  Â True-HyperÂ outside kick. Â This term is used almost exclusively in TKT communities and is almost never used by mainstream users. Â Shuriken (Variation) is also a type of variation on the invert axis.  s a type of variation, the term is used widely in both mainstream and TKT.
Shuriku:  modern slang term for shuriken-twist.  double twistingÂ variationÂ where a shuriken is executed in the first twist.
Single (Twisting):  ny inverted trick with one twist around the vertical axis, ending at the complete landing position.
Singular:Â  This term describes a transition in which only one leg ever lands.
Skip:Â  The secondary form of a vanish transition in which both feet never touch the floor at the same time.Â  (BasicÂ / dvanced)
Snapu: Â Taken from the snapuswipe, this is anyÂ variationÂ where a swipe is followed by a full twist. Â In terms of the use of this suffix, the swipe is implied and does not need to be named. For example, aÂ full-swipe + twist is a full snapu. Â Like several other variations, the name of the original trick, the snapuswipe, is starting to beÂ shortened to snapu by many members of the community because there is no swipe at the end, as is implied.
Squirrel: Â See Rodeo.  rguably not a distinctly different variation from the rodeo grab, the performer reaches for, but never actually grabs, their ankle.
Stepover (Takeoff): Â See Swing (Takeoff).
Swing (Takeoff):   method ofÂ takeoffÂ where the performer lifts their inside kicking leg while pivoting up to 180 degrees in the direction of their typical rotation. Â This takeoff can be used from either frontside (by swinging the leg away from the target) or, more commonly, backside stance (by swinging toward the target). Â This takeoff is also often referred to as a Stepover.
Swingthrough:  singular transition in which the in-air leg travels in an unobstructed linear fashion directly into the next takeoff.Â  (BasicÂ / dvanced)
Swipe: Â true-hyper inside kick, generally a round kick, performed while on an inverted axis. Â The target is generally high in the air, often directly above the performer.
Swipe Knife:  See Jackknife and Swipe. Â The Swipe KnifeÂ suffixÂ is added to inverted tricks, not vertical kicks. Â It is similar to a Jackknife, but because it occurs in an inverted trick, it substitutes a swipe in place of an inside kick. Â This is both a specific inverted trick, as well as a variation type on any inverted axis.
TKT (True Kick Terminology):   systemized approach to the study of tricking, founded by Dan Perez DeTejada. Â This system is widely known for naming kicks by their true rotational values. Â TKT is often synonymous with the eriformÂ system which is known for its systemized break down of all parts of tricking, from takeoffs and landings, to transitional definitions, and beyond.
Tornado (Kick):Â  One of the most basic kicks, and often the first kick trick people learn.  tornado kick is a cheat takeoff followed by 180 degrees of in-air rotation, and a round kick.Â  In TKT, this is written as a cheat-360-round.
Transition:  The method of connecting 2 tricks in a combo. Â Transitions are broken intoÂ several typesÂ based on the sequence of landing one trick and taking off into the next. Â Tricks such as scoots and cartwheels are not transitions, although they are occasionally incorrectly labeled as such.
Triple (Kicking): Â This is most often associated with three consecutive, alternating kicks to the target while spinning. Â Technically anytime three kicks are delivered in-air it can be considered a triple, but there is usually a more specific set of suffixes to use.
Triple (Twisting):  ny inverted trick with three twists around the vertical axis ending at the complete landing position.
True-Hyper (Vert): Â landingÂ in which 180 degrees of rotation is performed after a vertical kick that lands on the kicking leg. Â This specific term is used almost exclusively within the TKT community, and implied by the term Hyper among most mainstream (terminology) users. Â See also Katana (Vert) and Shuriken (Vert).
Tsunami (Kick):Â  More widely known as a stepover-hook, The tsunami name is a slang term used in the TKT and Cinematic/Hyper Tricking systems.Â  The tsunami is a swing takeoff, followed by 180 degrees of in-air rotation, and a hook kick.Â  In TKT this is also written as a swing-360-hook.
Turbo (Landing):  two footed landing.Â  This term is relatively uncommon, but gaining in popularity.
Twist:Â  For the purpose of this site, twist will always describe rotation on the vertical axis during an inverted trick. Â It is not uncommon for people to refer to any rotation on the vertical axis as twist, regardless of the performerâ€™s orientation.
Unified:Â  This term describes landings and takeoffs as using both feet simultaneously.Â  When used to describe aÂ transition, it means that either the landing, takeoff, or both the landing and takeoff of the transition uses both feet simultaneously.
Vanish:  sequential transition in which the landing and takeoff follow the same sequence.Â  Vanish can be likened to walking.Â  (BasicÂ / dvanced)
Variation:  Performing any trick in a way that deviates from its base skill. Â This often means the addition of a kick or grab, or a specific alteration of the movement to enhance the aesthetic.
Vert Kick:  kick delivered with no major degree of inversion. Â The performer stays upright throughout the entire trick.Â  (Vert Basics)
WackKnife:  variationÂ on the Jackknife where the rotation between the first and second kicks is removed. Â Upon hitting the target with an inside kick, the performer rechambers the kick while simultaneously chambering and executing the outside kick to the same target. Â This is almost always accomplished by using inside and outside crescent kicks which allow the hips to to stay open and fixed while the legs are in motion. Â This is both a specific vert kick, as well as a variation type on both the vertical and inverted axis. Â In some versions of TKT, the wackknife suffix is used to note a true-hyper inside kick that lands in a frontside stance.
Whirlwind:Â   variation on the Fei Long pattern, where the performer spin an entire 540 degrees of rotation (Hyper + Gyro) between the outside kick and inside kick, rather than the standard 180 degrees. Â This term is almost exclusive to TKT users.

Windex (Windex Swipe):  slang term for a raiz hyper-hook.Â  Commonly understood as a swipeknife without a swipe. s such, many trickers choose to shorten the term to simply Windex, to avoid any confusion.

Wrap: lso known as wrapthrough, the wrap has many meanings. s a transition, wraps are a often understood as a swingthrough into a sideflip.Â  The wrap term is also used in vert kicking to describe a cheat takeoff from backside stance, as well as to describe typical cheat takeoffs that rotate on the ground past what is typically accepted. This term is not without controversy, though it is widely used and accepted within the community.  (Basic/ advanced)
X-Out (X):   variation and position in which both legs are kicked out into a straddle position in-air. Â This variation is generally reserved for inverted tricks.
Zoot:  Related to getting high, generally from marijuana or dabs.</Text>

            <Title>Ski/ Snowboard Parallel</Title>
            <Text>To paint this picture a little better we can take a look at the dynamics between skiing and snowboarding. If you know anything about the history there you will know that in the beginning snowboarders were not welcome at the ski resorts alongside the skiers. Snowboarding was viewed by many as a nuisance. The snowboarders themselves being viewed as rebellious troublemakers and vagrants that were there to ruin the good time of skiers. 
The ski world was one of money, affluence and decorum. You dressed a certain way, acted a certain way, and if you were at the ski resort, you had some money. The snowboarding world was one of passion, exploration, and freedom, rules be damned. Snowboarding was taking heavy influence from skateboarding and the anti-establishment culture that was on the rise in that era.
The focus was on the passion for the sport and the artform that it created. Exploring the unexplored, and doing the not-yet-done. This was butting heads with the more uniform and structured ski-world. This isn’t to say that Skiers weren’t pushing the boundaries within their own world, they absolutely were. However, the general culture at the ski-resorts was not this. 
This clash between skiers and snowboarders is very similar to the clash of the Trickers and the Gymnasts/Cheerleaders. Two extraordinarily different worlds coming into the same space. In both cases, the space created by the more organized and rigid world. In both cases, the explorers being poorly received at first. Eventually though, these worlds would figure out ways to exist alongside each other, in many cases giving great benefits to one another.
One of the biggest benefits being access to an improved training ground. Having access to these facilities would allow the athletes to become deeply skilled in their crafts.    </Text>

            <Title>Invert Tricks</Title>
            <Text>Flips, or more accurately invert tricks. These are the basis for all of the higher level tricks. We can start with the two footed take off flips. This is where the early Trickers started when bringing these moves into the martial arts they were doing. It began with the Backflip, Frontflip, and occasionally the left or right sideflips. Within the framework we laid out before we can give these a more accurate names. The Backflip and the Frontflip need no change to line up easily with our BIFO grid, however instead of referring to the sideflips by left or right, we can use Inside(left for left twisters) and Outside(right for left twisters. 
	In each of the cases of these flips, BackFlip, Frontflip, InSideFlip, OutSideFlip. We can see they tell us the orientation of the Trickers body throughout the flip by designating which BIFO stance they are performed in. Which immediately tells us where our momentum is going by its definition! Each of these flips when performed follow the same general pattern of jump in air&gt; somersault&gt; land on ground. Nothing particular fancy going on just a head over heels tumble through the air. It is these inverts that give us the baseline for the formation of a striking majority of the other possible tricks.  
	Starting to variate these 4 basic inverted flips we can first look at their one footed counterparts. This brings us into our Advanced Stances grid that covers the full range of BIFO x CHMS potentials. These inverts take off from a single foot and utilize a swing of some form to assist the jumping leg in generating power. The various swings are discussed in a later section but it is important to note that the swings we will be talking about next will all be counter to your DOM.
***Insert Graphic DOM &amp; Swing Direction*** 
	We effectively have 6(8 if you count the Darkside gainer/webster (bad swing leg)). Each of these uses the one of the 4 base flips and manipulates them in some way. Backside gives us Gainer. Inside Gives us Aerial and GMS. Frontside gives us webster. Outside gives us Raiz and Lotus. We will start first with the Gainer and the Webster, then we will move into the Aerial, Raiz and eventually the GMS and Lotus. 
	A Gainer is a backflip swung off of one leg. In the case of a left twister this is generally done with the Left foot used as a plant foot and the right foot generating the swing up into the air in front of the performer. After swinging into the air the Tricker performs a backflip and comes back into the Backside or Backside Complete landing position. The webster is the front flips version of this. It is typically swung off of the left plant leg with the right swing leg generating an arc up behind them, after jumping into the air a front flip is performed and the Tricker lands in a Frontside or Frontside Semi landing position. 
	An aerial is an inside flip performed off of the leading leg(inside (left)) where the performer swings the trailing leg (right) up in the direction that is counter to their DOM. The Raiz is an outside flip performed off the leading leg (outside(right) where the performer swings the trailing leg (left) up in the direction counter to their DOM. 
	GMS stands for GrandMasterSwipe and is an inside flip performed off of the trailing (outside(right)) leg. Where the swing is performed by the leading (inside(left)leg). This move is similar to an aerial but takes off from the opposite foot. Lotus can be thought to be similar to the raiz in the same way. It is an outside flip performed off of the trailing (inside(left)leg). 
	This covers all of the base flips can be used to build up to a vast majority of the other Tricks. Before we start adding more parameters to use in variations we should discuss at more length the swings. There are effectively 6 base swings. Each of these are named in convention with the Tricks that they come from and can be mapped out using the advanced circle of swings as pictured below. As we can see in the graphic the Direction of Swing will always go counter to the Direction of Momentum for these swings. 
*** Insert Graphic Advanced Circle of Swings***
#
	These swings cover the swings out of backside, frontside, inside, and outside stances. In the cases of backside and frontside. Both can be performed by either leg although the left twisting (counter-clockwise) Tricker typically defaults to using their left leg to plant and their right leg to swing. In the case of backswing the swing starts behind the performer and swings in front of them to generate lift into a back fliping motion. In the case of frontswing the swing starts in front of the performer and swings behind them to generate lift into a forward swinging motion. The inside swings are both performed when the performers hips are effectively facing inside. The inside swings include the Aerial Swing which takes off from the leading leg (left) and the GrandMasterSwing(GM-Swing) which takes off from the trailing leg (right). The outside swings include the Raiz Swing and the Lotus Swing. Both of these are performed when the performers hips are effectively facing outside. The Raiz Swing takes off from the leading leg(right) and the Lotus Swing takes off from the trailing leg(left). 
	Many people will often refer to the aerial and raiz swings as frontswings because they move in a similar front to back motion, however this negates the hip placement that the performer gets into during the swing. By using these 6 different swings we have a more accurate way of referencing the orientation of the performers legs to their hips during the swing into the Trick they will perform. This is only necessary when breaking the tricks down into their pieces to be understood as the swing is implied by simply stating the Trick being performed. Such as Gainer (backswing), Webster(frontswing), Aerial(AerialSwing) etc. Knowing how to break these down into smaller elements that can be utilized within the anatomy of a trick allows for the performer to start putting things in places they don't typically appear and finding something new and interesting.
	Simply take the concept of swings we just laid out. That the Direction of Swings usually go counter to their DOM. What would happen if we rotated this to swing perpendicular to our DOM? We would quickly discover a whole new set of swings that can be utilized to create never been seen before Tricks! Some people have already started playing with some ideas like this in the case of things like the Tunnel, and Bullet flips. Not to mention a list of tricks that have yet to begin being named but are already being performed.

            <Title>Cork</Title>
            <Text>If you remember from the history section, the first Triple Cork was landed just over a decade ago in 2009 by Scott Skelton and now in 2021 it seems as though you encounter people able to Triplecork at any Tricking session you go to. But, What exactly is a cork? We’ve mentioned them several times now and unless you were curious and perused the glossary you might be thinking of a wine stopper, or when I said corkscrew you might have thought of the wine stopper removal tool. Neither of these are correct. If you recall back to the first encounter we described with tricking where we said,
 “You’re watching as someone is running and it seems like they’re about to jump and do something but you have no idea what. As your curiosity peaks, you see one leg leave the ground, swinging upward in the air with arms flailing towards the sky as the other leg jumps to match it, as they lift into the air they contort into themselves in a way that generates a spin. The person is now upside down flying through the air, flipping and rotating around themselves in a way that can only end in a crash to the head, but as you continue to watch, they unfurl their bodies while hurtling towards the ground, repositioning with their feet underneath to land only to continue moving seamlessly into the next display of acrobatics, with seeming control and grace, yet a raw unfettered power being released.”
We were actually describing a cork here! A much easier way to think of a cork is to think of a gainer full done off axis. Gainer tells us that this is a one footed swing into a backflip, full referring to the amount of rotation, in this case 360 degrees, and the off-axis part. What do we mean by off axis? Well anytime you rotate around a point, the point you rotate around becomes the axis. When we are standing up and down we can picture our axes going through us like the picture below. One coming from the Top through our center, this will represent where we rotate around when we are twisting. One through our hips that we can flip around or show inversion on. And One that determines the path of our flip, whether it is upright or on an angle. This last one will determine how much flatspin we will need to introduce in order to accomplish the trick.
Flipping on the Vertical axis is 100% Flip with 0% Flatspin However as we change that angle we will get different ratios of flip to flatspin. This is something that can and often is used to its advantage. In the case of corks they were originally very different from a gainer-full and were much closer to a swing into a btwist rotation on the horizontal axis. These &quot;old-school corks&quot; were actually a swing up into a horizontal body position with the hips and face facing upwards, where the performer would then rotate 540 degrees in order to land on their feet again. Over time this changed to include more inversion on the flipping axis which resulted in less rotation needed to make it back to the feet. 
	When we look at a flip with a full rotation it requires that the performer execute roughly 360 degrees of flip and 360 degrees of rotation in order to come back to the starting position. In the case of the &quot;old-school cork&quot; we just described it only has 180 degrees of flip and compensates for that by adding the missing 180 degrees of flip to its rotation. Resulting in the 540 degrees of rotation they used to have. The corks of today have found the sweet spot between these two extremes. One where the swing typically is performed off axis by a few degrees to place the performer on the diagonal rather than the horizontal or vertical axis.  This new diagonal axis is often referred to as the cork axis and allows for the performer to somewhat cheat the total rotation required to perform the trick successfully. 
The utilization of this new axis was something that quickly catapulted progress in tricking forward. It was a more naturally efficient way for the body to move when performing many of these movements that were desired. It also truly separated it from a majority of the other movement based sports. For the first time people were intentionally doing things &quot;crooked&quot; by many disciplines standards. Gymnastics for example has a rigid set of rules that determine the quality of a gymnastics skill performed, one of which is whether they were holding &quot;proper form&quot;. This is something tricking has all but thrown out. While there are criteria to meet, the requirements are a bit more open and allow for more creativity to be imbued in each trick.</Text>

            <Title>Sessions of the Past</Title>
            <Text>
The session. It is a Tricker’s training ground. The place where we go to hone our skills and make improvements, and most importantly fail. Failure is one of the biggest parts of progress in tricking. A willingness to overcome that failure is at the heart of every good session. When we fail, we learn. It is never fun failing but that is the way it is with everything.
One of the great things about Tricking is you really don’t need anything in order to do it.  Unlike many sports there is no ball, or board that you need to purchase or acquire in order to start. You could be naked in a desert and have everything you need to start Tricking. That’s not to say there aren’t some tools or apparatus that we might want to use along the way. Many times we use things like Trampolines, Spring Floors, and Crash Mats. Often the best place to go for access to these things is to the already established Gymnastics or Cheerleading gyms. 
The sessions taking place today are very different from the sessions that were taking place when I first came into Tricking over a decade ago. Today tricking is slowly taking its place as a respected activity in a gymnastics gym or martial arts dojo. This comes only after years of trickers paving the way for that relationship. 
In the early days Tricking was viewed as the anti-christ from within the purview of the gymnastic/cheerleading world. The lack of rigid rules when it came to form and execution was not something the gymnastsic oriented folks could get behind. To them we were just hurling our bodies in the air with absolutely no understanding as to what we were doing. A surefire way to get injured, the last thing they wanted to deal with. So we would often be denied access to train. Open Gyms were primarily designated for the Gymnasts or children, not for a group of rowdy teenagers that want to flail around.
In order to gain access to training time people would often call the gyms and ask if their was anytime the gym was available to train in when it was unoccupied. In many cases this resulted in getting laughed off the phone and being told only gym members have access to the facility. If you were diligent though you would eventually find somewhere that would let you come into train. Often when the gym closed for the evening and the coaches were doing cleanup. We were so grateful for this time. 
If you were really lucky you would befriend some of the coaches or gym owners and have fairly regular access to session time. Most of the time though you were lucky to get a few sessions a month. As time went on Trickers were getting better, cleaner, and insanely technically difficult, to the point where anyone with an acrobatics background could start to see that this was something that was here to stay. This isn’t to say they welcomed us in with open arms. No, it was a much more begrudging shift that happened over many years. 
Over the years, many of these gym owners and coaches started to recognize the passion, and drive these Tricker’s had at every session. While the technical difficulty was noted the worlds of gymnastics and Cheerleading were still not ready to bring Tricking into their core business model. Trickers, while impressive, were still viewed as just a group of rowdy teenagers who lacked discipline and proper form. 
Within the spheres of gymnastics and cheerleading, rules reign supreme. There is a specific form and structure each movement must adhere to otherwise points will be deducted. Uniformity in execution is placed in higher regard than the ability to be creative and differentiate yourself. Skill levels are often capped by the level you compete at and at the top levels several moves have been made illegal due to their dangerous nature. This leveling of the playing field is actually stagnating these art forms. Placing a rigid structure on these is preventing further progress by punishing those who would push it forward.

            <Title>A Glimpse of the Past</Title>
            <Text>	Before we dive fully into the complexity of categories and terms that we use to describe Tricking we should briefly discuss Tricking’s Origin and how we got to this point. It wasn’t always this complex. In the beginning there were only a few Tricks being performed and most of them were very commonplace within other movement disciplines. What changed is that they started being done in a completely new setting, in the middle of traditional Martial Arts Kata’s. Kata is a Japanese word meaning “form”. These “forms” typically refer to a series of choreographed Martial Arts movements designed to be practiced alone or in sync with others. They are used as a way to demonstrate, as well as cultivate, the practitioners mastery of skills. Within Martial Arts these are typically combinations of kicks, blocks, chops, and punches showing skills that are learned within the specific Martial Art the practitioner engages in. Outside of Martial Arts, Kata can refer to a “way of doing” with emphasis on the form and order of the process. In other words, a deeply focused, embodied practice. 
It is important to quickly note that moving the human body in acrobatic ways has been a part of cultures as far back as we have records. Manipulating the body in strange ways that resemble moves we commonly label as Tricks today were often used within various Tribal rituals. They would use these to invoke trance states as well as express themselves through movement, feeding off each other. These weren’t the only occurrences, there were also acrobats and dancers throughout time who were performing some of these body manipulations, although it wasn’t until the 1980’s that they would begin to form into what we call Tricking today. 
The precursor to Tricking was when Martial Artists started adding some extra rotation to their kicks. These types of spinning jump kicks were going to be less useful in an actual fight, however for the sake of performance inside the Sport Martial arts circuit, these were the perfect crowd pleaser to get some extra attention. These more technically difficult movements were catching eyes from the up and coming youth practitioners. Some with in the Sport Karate World were starting to add flips and other acrobatics to their competitive forms to distinguish themselves even farther. 
Large credit goes to Ernie Reyes Jr. and the West Coast Demo Team. This is where it really began for Tricking. This team was performing their Kata’s with increasing difficulty and flare to a wide audience. As more and more practitioners of Martial Arts were seeing these demonstrations where spins were added to the jump kicks, and acrobatics incorporated into the routines, the competition started to expand to favor these types of moves. So much so that it inspired Michael Chaturantabut, commonly known in the community as Mike Chat, to create Extreme Martial Arts in the 1990s. This was a tournament dedicated to the incorporation of these acrobatic Martial Arts movements that were less in line with some of the traditional ways of Sport Martial Arts. 
This new niche that was growing within the larger Martial Arts Competition circuit was creating waves. As more Martial Artists were doing Tricks then ever before and with the rise of the Internet, people started posting their footage online. At first they were just sending small 5-10 second clips to each other via email and other online servers. That is until Billy Billing founded Bilang.com in February of 2000. This became not only the go to hub for those in the know about Martial Arts Tricks, but the launchpad for Tricking as we know it 20 years later. 
Up to this point the Tricks being done were primarily Kicks with more jump or rotation added and some Flips such as aerials, backflips, and back handsprings. These Tricks were usually sandwiched between hand combos and demonstrations of particular static kicks. That is, for what was performed on stage. There was also an entire underground practice taking place after hours at these sport martial arts competitions. The people who trained Tricks would get together off-stage and have sessions. Taking turns demonstrating their most exciting or creative movements and challenging each other. Performing moves that were often unnamed and pushing the boundaries of what Martial Arts could contain. 
Many of the Tricks and variations that were being performed in the early 2000s came as a natural response to the rules imposed in the competition circuit. With the rise of these acrobatic movements being pushed into the competitive martial arts circuits the judges began limiting how many “gymnastics” moves were allowed, saying that each move had to have a “martial” intent behind it. It was rules like these that inspired things like the FlashKick, Corkscrew Kick variations and more. 
Bilang.com was posting all types of Martial Arts Tricks being performed within the Sport Martial Arts world and it opened up the audience to the entirety of the internet. At first the site was largely frequented by Sport Martial Artists looking to one up the competition and trade techniques, however there was also a growing group throughout the early 2000s that stumbled upon this website and began to attempt these moves with no Martial Arts background or formal training. Watching these “off-stage” sessions an entire generation was inspired to go into their backyards and throw their bodies in the air to try the things they were seeing.  
This new group of people coming into this with little or no martial arts background would refer to moves however it made sense to them. Which was fine until people wanted to discuss what they were doing, or share tips. An agreement on terms had to be decided if any communication was going to be possible. Bilang was one of the first places where the terms for these things began to be debated online and “working names” settled upon. It was from here many of the “base” tricks started getting their names. “Base” tricks can be thought of as the starting building blocks of tricking. These are tricks that typically are viewed as foundational, or entry level by todays standards, although at one point they were the entirety of what made up Martial Arts Tricks. 
Another major contribution Billy Bilang’s website made to tricking was the popularization of the sampler format for sharing Tricks. A sampler is a compiled series of video clips edited together highlighting the most exciting movements from someone’s training. At first these were highlights from the Sport Martial Arts Competitions or the off-stage Trick sessions but as time went on backyard trickers started sharing their training clips as well. Eventually people would put large production efforts into creating these compilations to share with their online “Martial Arts Tricks” friends. 
Around 2003 Sean Cannon created Club540.com which is still a fantastic resource to this day. Originally It was created as a forum with an emphasis on sharing clips with each other. It was basically YouTube for trickers before Youtube existed. For the first few years it was structured with a free account and paid optional increase in download/upload rates. This was a Godsend for the backyard Tricks community. Sean made it quite public that he wanted to create a space where anyone could come to learn Tricks, removing some of the barriers that the XMA crowd were putting up. Debates within the community on various forums were taking place around whether or not Tricking needed to be Martial Arts based, or if the Tricks were required to have kicks. Now, if you have been a part of the community for any amount of time you will know that this debate is still taking place in certain circles. So with this new friendly approach to non-martial artists who wanted to learn some Tricks there were a few people who really stepped up to make newbies feel included when asking questions. Some of these people are still active in the community as I’m writing this and it warms my heart to see their consistency of a positive message a decade and a half later.  
Bilang.com eventually closed down its server in the mid 2000s due to cost of operating it with the growing popularity as it wasn’t generating any revenue. In it’s stead Jon “jujimufu” Call created TricksTutorials.com which became the new home to the Martial Arts Tricks Community. These non-martial artists started calling themselves Tricksters or Trickers to refer to the Martial Arts Tricks they were performing. TricksTutorials became the go to place to get tips, share footage, and in general participate in the community. People would use it as a way to link up in the real world and share the skills they had been training. 
People had used Bilang from time to time to connect in person but this was usually at pre-existing tournaments within the Sport Karate World such as the Charlie Lee Nationals. CLN was one of the “go-to” spots to throw down some tricks in the off-stage Trick session. TricksTutorials with its large non-martial-arts base became a place where Trickers began to organize gatherings outside of the Sport Karate world. The birth of gatherings came about in the early 2000s with the 2003 Toronto Gathering and they were not the tricking “Events” of today. In their early stages it was just a few random guys on the Internet who decided they wanted to meet up and do some flips together. 
Although the intention was just to get together with some friends to have a good time, these gatherings would prove to be foundational in the rapid progression of skill within the sport as well as adding elements that would make Tricking something entirely different then it had been. That’s because up until this point many of the Martial Artists that were training Tricks to perform in their competitive forms were largely focused on cleanliness and what would impress the judges. Now with these backyard trickers they were doing what was fun, or exciting, they didn’t mind if it wasn’t going to win any points in a competition. The only thing they were concerned with was “can it be done”. 
By around 2005, Sean Cannon had compiled the initial version of the Trictionary. It began with 100 Tricks that had been commonly talked about within the community, a brief description of the movement and an accompanying video clip. Nearly 15 years later and Club540.com is still one of the best Tricktionaries for any aspiring Tricker. It has since stripped off many of the original features of the site leaving only the Trictionary now with over 350 moves described. 
Having a central place with many of the Tricks listed out, with video clips, and descriptions, allowed for people to really view the Trick set that was being created and start to find new ways to push the boundaries. Discussions under these Tricks would lead to clarification of some of the terms as time would go on. With more accurate language to describe the moves they were performing, Trickers were able to share better tips and people with no training could really start to engage with some of these concepts. 
This new language that was beginning to form was allowing not only for people to discuss the Tricks that they were doing but was also giving birth to an entire new generation of Tricks that would come out of this. Having terms to represent some of these movements and ways of breaking them down into the parts that make them, allowed for people to start really puzzling with the various pieces. A wave of creativity was exploding within the scene as more people discovered these complex ways of linking moves together and adding variations to moves that were thought to be done evolving. Tricking was just starting to really stretch it’s legs.
It was around this time in 2006 that Dan Perez Tejada developed the True Kick Terminology often called TKT. TKT was a systematized way of breaking down kicks into their natural progressions. Utilizing the different base kicks, rotations, and various landing options to piece together the new naming system. It was a bit more cumbersome than the mainstream terminology however it would prove to be very useful to visualize the components that make up the particular kick based Trick being attempted. 
Dan Perez, Nick Vail and a few others tried pushing TKT out into the Tricking culture in the years between 2006-2010 however the system was not widely adopted. Those who saw TKT for what it was however, jumped on board and began to incorporate this way of thinking about their other Tricks as well. People were starting to see the bigger picture of Tricking and its potential. 
Variations to moves, integrating different movement influences into tricks and the transitions between them were really being explored during this time. People like Sesshoumaru and Kyle McClean were leading the charge and a wave of people were responding. We had things like FullSnapu, CorkDlegTwist and CorkSnapu being done. Variations now weren’t just for the end of tricks, you could do them in the beginning, the middle, or the end. Trickers were starting to open the doors for what Tricking was to become.  
What began as individual Tricks that would be sprinkled into the competitive form had grown to be a series of linked Tricks. These developing combos started with just a few moves in them with awkward transitions between. As the communities understanding grew, so did everything, not just the individual Tricks themselves but how many Tricks were being done successively. It went from small combos of Tricks with three to four main moves all the way up to these insanely long 15 plus Trick combos. 
As this online community of backyard trickers was growing quickly in numbers across the internet, the operating costs for TricksTutorial.com ballooned and would eventually fall to the same problem as its predecessor. The community attempted to crowdfund the website to keep it open but this only lasted a short time. Noticing the need for a community forum space, Dave C pushed for and moderated TrickSession.com. TrickSession began as an alternative to the TricksTutorials.com forum. Eric Benjamin created TricksSession after he had noticed that the forums on TricksTutorials were being overrun with trolls and the good information was becoming harder to find without sifting through irrelevant posts. The aim for TrickSession was a place to discuss techniques from a more serious approach and leave the bullshitting for somewhere else. Eric wanted to create High Quality Photo Tutorials with slow motion videos and encourage a deeper conversation. This was a place for Trickers for a brief time, however as other social media platforms began to rise there was an exodus from the forums as people took up YouTube for video hosting, and Facebook became the default place to link up with other Trickers, plan gatherings, and share samplers and raw footage. 
YouTube being the new home for Tricking videos gave birth to a new era of samplers and sharing footage. People began discovering this thing organically by browsing through youtube and finding these videos of these insane ninja flips. This brought more and more people into the online tricks community potentially contributing to the downfall of TricksTutorials. The YouTube sampler era was just beginning. Trickers started trying to say something specific with their samplers in this time. They became more than just training footage but rather vignettes into their lives. A statement of who they were becoming through the exploration of Tricking. Trickers tried to capture that discovery of themselves and put it out there for the world in one video. Through a snapshot of that series of moments unfolding. The process itself. 
These inspiring video scrapbooks people were creating invigorated the scene with creativity. The generation of Trickers that would discover it at this time would put a large value on the samplers that were more than just the Tricks. Trickers were suddenly becoming videographers just to enhance the way they could share their training footage. Making sure to capture b-roll of their lives surrounding the session time. And it wasn’t just training footage anymore. Trickers were going out of their way to curate specific Tricks and in specific locations to create the right vibe for their video. 
These productions became so intense that many took to releasing “teaser” samplers before. Typically showing off 30-45 seconds of highlight footage to get people anticipating the release. The most acclaimed Trickers often garnering thousands of views within the first few days, which in 2008-2011 was a big deal. The people who found these videos would be experiencing what we outlined in the beginning of this book. A raw encounter with this movement based exploration. 
Tricking for the last two decades had been mostly comprised of Martial Artists performing Tricks that came as natural progressions from movements other people had been doing. However, with the boom of the internet in the 2000’s the rise of individuals coming out of all these unique non-martial arts backgrounds came together to explore these Tricks further and in different ways. The backyard Tricker was slowly becoming the majority. By 2012 there was a noticeable shift in the community, the people showing up at gatherings were predominantly these people who had found Tricking randomly on the internet, people who had no idea of the history of this exploration and where it came from. This also created a unique opportunity, many of these people who were coming into it from outside of the martial arts world started creating a different understanding of these movements and how they relate with one another. These different maps that were starting to bud would lead to an increased understanding of these Tricks within the community. 
The gathering scene was also exploding from the late 2000’s into the early 2010’s, what used to be a few hooligans getting together and crashing an open gym had turned into weekend long events where the entire facility was dedicated to Tricking for those 3 days only. People were traveling from all over the world on a regular basis to participate. Often taking weeks to months off from their lives to immerse themselves within the Tricking Culture. What was once a few gatherings a year had turned into a few gatherings a month. By 2015 there was nearly a Gathering per weekend depending on how far you were willing to travel. 
Through technology and the intense gathering scene from 2006-2012 Trickers were spreading their skills and helping others push the boundaries of what the human body was capable of. Tricks themselves now had an expansive amount of difficulty and complexity that was added in a short period of time. As soon as someone landed the “Worlds First” the doors were blown open for anyone who wanted to follow suit. Scott Skelton landed the first double full swing double cork in 2008 and just a year after landed the worlds first triple cork. It was only months before the number of people who could land these moves were in the double digits. A few years later and there would be hundreds if not thousands of people who can perform what was the pinnacle of tricking difficulty in 2009. Tricks and Combos that were thought to be impossible, things that were literally joked about at gatherings among Trickers were now being performed, and on a regular basis. This expansion of difficulty also came as a natural response to the increase in people teaching Tricking as its own discipline. Trickers were starting to develop various Tricking specific programs to slot into Gymnastics gyms and Martial Arts Schools all over the world. Certain individuals that had seen the big picture of Tricking made attempts to disperse their knowledge out into the world. Various formal and informal systems of Tricking started popping up.
One of the most pivotal systems that came out was brought to us from the same guy that introduced TKT to Tricking. Dan Perez had continued working on understanding Tricking from a more technical aspect. Trying to create a system with names for things people were already starting to play with. Around 2010 he started noticing that the system he was developing was showing holes. There was something missing. By 2011 he had realized that the landing possibilities were much more complex and there was a lot of untapped potential there. 
Aeriform, which had originally launched in 2006 as Dan’s Tricking coaching business had evolved over the years into what it became in 2011, the Aeriform Martial Arts Tricking System. He initially put it out on his website AeriformMAT.com after he had to close his first attempt at a Training facility failed due to zoning issues with the city and huge losses. With all the work already done for his school and no school Dan wanted to spread this information regardless. He also shifted this system into what he would market as Cinematic Martial Arts. This was a progression system he could teach to school owners that would facilitate the learning of the Aeriform MAT system. 
People like Ish Payne and Travis Wong saw the vision of what Dan was talking about. Ish was actually the first person to go through the entire curriculum over the phone. This was before Dan had fully created the video system to go along with the progression he was developing. Ish quickly brought the concepts into his school Martial Posture. Travis Wong had been running White Lotus since 2010 having coaches such as the Three Amigos, Danny Graham, Anis Shurfa, and Jeremey “Prodigy” Marinas, but Dan was offering something different. In Travis’s next gym project Joining All Movement where he was bringing together the worlds of Tricking, Parkour, and Movie Stunts he wanted to give Dan’s project a shot. Dan would move down to LA in 2012 to run the Cinematic Martial Arts Program out of the new JAM facility. 
When he put it on his website was the first time the Tricking community was exposed to the concepts of Complete, Hyper, Mega, and Semi as the 4 main Landing Stances. Nick Vail also released the famous Landing Stances for Nate Hitpas video. However it wasn’t until around 2014 when Brian Skinner launched TrickTheory.com that these ideas would catch on in the community at large. TrickTheory was Brians way of trying to push the ideas that Dan had pioneered and really bring them to a larger audience. 
Brian Skinner was able to take the ideas that Dan Perez, Nick Vail and others in the Colorado community had struggled to communicate and distill them into an understandable and coherent system. Taking time to make the connections between these things apparent using graphics showing the relationships between these Tricks. TrickTheory had taken the current state of Tricking as building blocks and laid it out for everyone to see how the pieces fit together.
This launched the next wave of boundaries being broken. At this point Tricking had solidified itself as something different from its beginning in Martial Arts Forms. It was now this pure exploration of every axis of movement the human body was capable of. It became this discovering the interplay of every category of movement. From ballet to ballroom dancing, martial arts to religious ceremonial movements, Trickers were taking influence from any movement they saw and asking how they could bring it into what they were doing when they were Tricking.
Tricking was now tinkering with every movement into and out of these Tricks as well as what was happening during, discovering where and how the body can move and what crazy shapes you can create in the air. With a solid landscape now established and a general language of terms taking hold in the culture anyone who discovered this thing from 2015 onward was on the fast track to getting good. 
Techniques had been refined, coaching methods were starting to develop and everyone had a camera phone in their pocket. Trickers were only a quick message away from getting feedback from the best in the world and they were taking advantage of this regularly. It was no longer a complete wild west of discovery. Most of these Tricks and Variations and Transitions all had names and criteria that was generally agreed upon. 
It was due to a critical mass of people asking Sam Kojo Plummer for advice on their tricks that actually led him to create Kojo’s Trick Lab at the end of 2017. Seeing the need for a unified platform filled with Tricking specific tutorials that covered many of the most commonly asked questions he was receiving. Realizing that he wasn’t the best person to teach every Trick and that actually multiple points of view on the same Trick from different trickers would benefit the community, he quickly enlisted the top Trickers from around the world to make tutorials on their personal expertise. Today Kojo’s Tricks Lab is absolutely the go to spot for a beginner coming into Tricking. What started as 40 video tutorials has grown into a repository of over 800 videos with over 350 tutorials on Tricking. 
What Kojo created was an evolution of what trickers like Dan Perez, Nick Vail, Sean Cannon, Jujimufu, and Eric Benjamin had attempted in the past. A streamlined way to deliver this understanding of Tricking to the average person who was trying to learn. Many ran into issues of being before their time with the ideas and platforms they were developing. Others just had too technical of an understanding and there was a language gap when talking to the rest of the community. However because Kojo was sourcing content from a variety of trickers there was enough diversity in the way things were being taught that there was a communication style available for everyone.
Tricking had finally stepped into it’s own and the communities understanding had mostly caught up with the few pioneers that had been leading the charge. The baseline terminology most trickers were using at gatherings and online was one that could communicate the nuance and technicality of many of these movements people were performing. In 2016-2018 more people than ever were trying to learn how to do these cool ninja flips and they knew to call it Tricking. 
Now we have an idea of how these moves were created over time but what exactly were they? What was this system that was developing through this exploration of movement. Lets go into some terminology to see the system at play. </Text>

            <Title>Shoulders of Giants</Title>
            <Text>	In all areas of human excellence we stand on the shoulders of giants. It was those who came before us and paved the way for something greater to emerge. They laid the frameworks out of which we can work towards the realization of something beyond their dreams. Each generation taking every advancement of it's predecessor and integrating it to the point where it falls into the background. Yesterdays Technological marvels are todays baseline of operation. It is this evolution of technologies that we build up that can get us to a future worth living in. Only if we develop these technologies in ways that allow for that development. 
	In our current society it is very common for people to hide their ideas behind pay-walls or intellectual property legalities like trademarking, copyrighting, and patenting their ideas, and they do so in a way that penalizes others who would want to build upon those ideas. Changing and improving them for the benefit of everyone. Everything has become a money grab where keeping ideas close to the chest is the best plan of action so you don't get pushed out of the game. It is this mentality that is holding us back from realizing the future that we all want so badly. That star trek future with flying cars, teleportation, space travel and so much more. 
	It doesn't have to be this way. In many areas there are people who have chosen to change the way they think about sharing ideas. It's actually rather common within the extreme sports industries, and absolutely present within Tricking. These cultures just want to share what they have learned back with their communities so that more people will start engaging with the activity. Their love for their activity and wanting as many people to experience the magic it offers their lives is very different from the attitudes that drive the general theories around intellectual property rights. 
	When making money isn't the overall goal people are willing to share information more freely because they see the benefits. If one person can contribute something that someone else can build upon and then pass along to another person to do the same things. After just a few generations we can have massive leaps of progress because we have allowed multiple people to add their inputs. This is how progress is made within every field, so it is beyond me why we continue to gatekeep this information when we know it is holding us all back. 
	Tricking would never have made the leaps in difficulty that it did if it was not for the decentralized network of contributers constantly sharing their minor alterations to the Tricks and allowing anyone to see and replicate them. Even going out of their way many times to help those trying to perform these Tricks do so easier, and faster.
	This was made possible in the early days by members of the community that saw a problem and had the ability to provide a solution. Websites like Yellowboy.com, Bilang.com, Club540.com, TricksTutorials.com, TrickSession.com, TrickTheory.com, Loopkicks.com/Trictionary and more have all helped the community by creating a space for the transfer of information. All of these projects were used to collect the various understandings of Tricking and what it was, and what these moves were, in one place. 
	Effectively they embody the idea and spirit of open-source. The belief that if someone makes something it would be better if they shared that with people how it was made and allowed them to build on top of that idea it would serve to benefit everyone in society. That we should allow multiple people to contribute to ideas when they have the time and the resources, or a particular skill set. It may be only one person who &quot;makes the discovery&quot; but it is because of all of the ideas that influenced that person that allowed them to get to that point. 
	When you experience this first hand within Tricking, watching the progress happen before your very eyes, you start to wonder why this isn't the standard everywhere. With the velocity of information in the 21st Century, we can share ideas to anywhere else in the world in seconds(or less). And you'll also realize that the people who made that possible, had figured that out. The world of open-source software embodies this concept better than anywhere, and has the most extensive literature surrounding the ideas. 
	At the core to the philosophy is that any problem with a sufficient amount of people looking at it becomes trivial to some person and they can solve it quickly. With the ability to solve problems quickly the improvements that will be made to the system will rapidly change it in a way that benefits the users.
	The only way to achieve something like this is to allow as many eyes on the problem as possible. Allowing each person who interacts with the system to make adjustments that improve it on an as needed basis, and for their particular use case. Keeping ideas locked behind paywalls and patents does not encourage this. The ideas that are sequestered will always move at a slower pace then those that were set free.
	Taking this approach to problems it is no longer the goal to be the one who finds the answer. But rather to investigate and discover all possible answers so we can see what works best given the context. The context, which is always changing will allow different solutions to fit better than others. Each of these different contexts that exist within the original domain will often fracture themselves off into sub-fields. 
	Fragmentation of a field into more specialized sub-fields has the ability to add immense value back to the domain it is derived from. As long as these specialists and generalists do not lose their ability to communicate. These specialists will often map things far deeper and more detailed then would have been if left to the generalists.  As a subfield becomes more and more specialized the language it will use to describe particular aspects of its domain will naturally become more complex as it maps the minutia. Sometimes to the detriment of communication between these specialists and the generalists of their containing field. 
	Communication between those with the up close, high detailed view and the overarching, set back, gestalt view is essential for us to have a full picture.  </Text>

            <Title>Exploring Terminology</Title>
            <Text>We can first look at these Tricks through each of the categories that we discussed earlier Kicks, Flips, and Twists. After which we will begin to discuss a new framework that attempts to do a better job at organizing the variety of movements, which were created by combining elements from these first three categories, to gives us the vast array of tricks and variations we have today.  
The first category Kicks contains some basic kicking movements which form all other higher level kicking tricks. The most important of kicking basics are the Vert Kicks. The two most used are the hook kick and the round kick. Other notable Kicks are the Inside and Outside Crescent Kicks, Sidekick, Back Kick, Front Kick, Split Kick and Axe Kick. It is out of these that all the higher level kicks developed. Adding rotation or variating the height of the body during the kick, how many hands were touching the ground, and the level of inversion to the kick. Out of this we get three main subcategories to break kicks into. The basic vert kicks we just described fit into the Vert Kicking category an then we have Ground Kicks, and Invert Kicks.
Vert Kicking contains its own subcategories of Pop Kicks, Cheat Kicks, and Swing Kicks. Each of these categories denotes the takeoff of each of these Tricks. Cheat tricks take off in a sequential vanish takeoff and perform a 180 degree rotation on the ground into chamber of the kick. Pop kicks take off from a two footed take off and jump simultaneously into the kick. Swings take off from one foot and swing into the chamber of a cheat kick. 
Vert Kicking is one of the few things in Tricking that has always maintained it’s two separate naming schools. There are the True Kick Terminology(TKT) people and the Mainstream people. Today many people use both side by side for different reasons. Mainstream is often easier to rattle off in a conversation about many kicks however TKT really helps to break the kicks into their elements and show what is taking place in the movement. TKT can be a great learning tool as the naming is more technical and explicitly tells you everything you need to know and do to perform it.  Mainstream Terms like Tornado Kick, 540, JackKnife, and CrowdAwakener leave a lot to be left understood. Where as the TKT equivalents like cheat360round, cheat360round hyper, cheat360round hyper hook, and cheat 360 split kick, spell it straight out. 
Ground kicks incorporate a much lower body position when executing the kick and will often have some part of the body either touching, or extremely low to the ground while performing. This may be a hand as in the case of something like a compasso or an e-kick. It could even be the majority of the body as in the case of sweep kicks.
Invert Kicks take many of the kicks from the Vert Kicking category and breathe new life into them by adjusting the axis they are performed on. The most notable of which are the double leg, which takes its origin from the parafuso, and the B-Kick coming out from Wushu origins which could now be argued to be a variation of an Aerial. 
As we discussed in the brief history section it was out of this first category of Kicks that the rest of Tricking built itself upon. It started with the traditional forms using the Round Kick, Side Kick, Back Kick and Axe Kick and adding jumps and some rotations to them. 
It was next that people started incorporating the second category of Flips. Moves like Backflip, Frontflip, and Sideflip are your pure flips and come directly from acrobatic sports like Gymnastics. Gymnastics also brought us things like the Backhandspring, Fronthandspring, and Cartwheel which were quickly adopted by the early Martial Artists doing Tricks. Over the years though this category of flips would expand to include many things that were much more than just flips. For this reason we could, and should rename these as Invert Tricks, more on that in a moment. 
The third category we discussed at the beginning of this section was Twisting and was incorporated into both Kicking and Flipping well before they started to be combined with each other. Adding rotation to a jumping Kick was where it began for Tricking in Martial Arts and acrobats had been flipping and rotating around themselves for millennia. It was only once the people who were doing Martial Arts Tricks started realizing that they could put all three together that we started to open the doors for what we call Tricking today.
If you came into Tricking before 2014 you most likely learned Tricks in terms of these three main categories and slowly built up an understanding that these are much more interconnected then the this categorical approach leads us to believe. These categories of Kicks, Flips and Twists aren't very accurate ways of dividing these tricks into groups. Many of the Tricks that now exist could technically fit themselves into any of these categories and that does not help us in building a framework that makes sense.
Instead of taking the approach many Trickers had to go through in the past where we would learn each individual move slowly unpacking the Russian nesting dolls of movement to see what was inside I thought we could take a different approach and lay the entire framework out from the ground up. Taking what was discovered over the last 20 or so years and distilling it down into a quasi-unified format. 
This new framework gives us a decently accurate way to discuss what is basically how the body is capable of moving within what I like to call the Tricking SOUP. SOUP, here, is an acronym for Sphere of Unrealized Potentials. Or put more simply, how are arms, legs and bodies can move within space. This is how much reach our arms and legs have as well as how high or far we can jump. 
** Insert Graphic TRICKING SOUP (SPHERE OF UNREALIZED POTENTIAL)** 
Once we understand how to interact with the SOUP we can pursue whatever avenues of Tricking excite us the most! Imagining some incredible things that we can then bring to life. </Text>

            <Title>Each Path to Tricking is Unique</Title>
            <Text>Each individual Tricker is going to develop their own path as they explore their way into Tricking, and each of those paths are going to be unique even if there is some overlap. People may go through different stages of Tricking at different times, or not go through certain ones altogether. Some people may explore a majority of the movements Tricking opens us up to, while others may spend the entirety of their Tricking years exploring a limited few concepts. It is completely up to the individual how they interact with this thing. Some will stick close to the movements they are exposed to while others start exploring the bodies potential for movement from the beginning. This creates a very difficult to explain hierarchy of things; as two people may place certain Tricks in different levels of difficulty based on their experience as well as other contributing factors. Due to this amorphous nature of this hierarchy it can be very challenging for a new individual to know where to begin to explore from. 
The good news is it’s relatively arbitrary where you begin. I say relatively because it has potential to influence where your Tricks will go from there based on which area you start to explore. Typically this acts to our benefit more than it does our disadvantage because we explore the things that are the most exciting and relevant to us and what we want our bodies to be doing. By allowing the new tricker to explore at their own discretion the interest that develops is a deeper one that seems to create a drive to overcome difficult tasks lying in the way to achieving the goal (performing the trick). 
This is largely how people develop their own style. By exploring the things relevant to themselves people are not only discovering what they like and don’t like but expressing that to everyone that is watching. The things that subjectively “feel” or sometimes “look” the best to them are going to make them come alive the most and want to further push themselves in that direction. 
We can only explore outward from where we begin. And we always begin where we do in terms of what is the most salient to us. Meaning what stands out to us the most. Where was our attention when we were watching? Was it the kicks? Was it the flips? Was it the swinging off one leg? Was it just a particular body shape of a movement that we found beautiful or strange? Whatever it was is the thing most relevant to us after witnessing Tricking is typically where the exploration attempts to begin. </Text>

            <Text>In this initial encounter we have with Tricking we are confronted with a series of opportunities to either continue investigating this thing, and learning it for ourselves; or to simply move on, abandoning the project in front of us. For those that do abandon it before getting to the stages of attempting or even investigating it deeper they don’t think twice about it. Other things are occupying their attention. On the other hand, those of us who continue the investigation do so not because of a conscious want or desire but from a pull that guides our attention back to this thing over and over again. It may take many encounters similar to the first one before we actively realize what we are pursuing. We just suddenly find ourselves immersed within this world of Tricking and are deeply engaged by it. 
As we are diving down this rabbit hole of information we are mapping these Tricking Terms to the visual “images” of them; and mapping these, to a description of the Trick; and the description, giving us information about its constituent parts; and how those parts, which are movement “chunks”,  are mapping back to our visual image of this Trick; developing a relatively decent approximation. Some may explore all of the terms they can find within Tricking well before attempting a move, while others may get only what they need to attempt the first one and just go for it. Regardless, a Tricker will encounter next a breakdown in their understanding of their relationship to their own body. No matter how well we imagined ourselves doing the Trick before attempting it for the first time, we always seem to be missing some element that we get confronted with in our experience first hand of it. 
After attempting to perform the move for the first time we are now afforded access to the realization of a gap in our knowledge and skill. Namely we don’t know how to move our legs and arms and not fall on our face trying these movements. We start to realize that in order to do these complex sets of movements known as a Trick we will have to develop an understanding of how to move our bodies in new and foreign ways. 
We then will begin breaking these Tricks down into manageable chunks of movement and working with our bodies to map to those pieces. Slowly training our experience to these various labels we learn and develop from and with the community of Trickers. These “Trick” names, terminology, labels, references, and descriptions we have for these things, exist primarily as a way for us to communicate to others, both our intentions, as well as our accomplishments. They are necessary only as a means for verbal or written reference to the actual movement embodied within the trick when the Tricker is performing the action. This verbal and non-verbal vocabulary is something each Tricker will develop through exploring tricking more as well as interacting with other Trickers. </Text>

            <Text>Flow State - why tricking is uniquely positioned to unlock it 
Flow States easier to attain when you've attained them before. Even if tasks are unrelated

Conditions of Flow
1. Clear Goals = objective distintinctively defined, immediate feedback
2. Skills suited for the challenge
3. Action and Awareness Merge
4. Concentration on Task at hand
5. Sense of Potential Control
6. Loss of Sense of Self, Sense of Growth, Connection to something bigger than oneself
7. Altered sense of time
8. Experience becomes Autotellic (activity is a goal in itself)

Flow = High Skill, High Challenge
Anxiety = Low Skill, High Challenge
Boredom = High Skill, Low Challenge
Apathy = Low/No Skill, Low/No Challenge

Flow, Anxiety, Boredom, Apathy are all based on your relative skill/challenge ratio not an overall difficulty

Flow is an escape forward into higher complexity.

            <Title>The Obsession</Title>
            <Text>When we get deeply interested in something it sort of spreads through our minds like an infection. Slowly taking over areas of our thought before we find ourselves consumed by it. It starts simple, with a curiosity, a desire to know more. We start out searching to get a sense of the big picture. Ironically we tend to get our sense of the big picture by looking in at the details and gathering the elements into a category that we can “make sense” out of. It’s this zooming in and out and in and then out again that allows us to start building up an accurate representational model of what we are exploring. Bringing the detailed features into their place in the gestalt. It’s only once we have a sufficiently organized model that we can start exploring this more. 
The process of developing this big picture understanding of some domain requires a lot of work. Unless there is a strong curiosity that drives the learning why would anyone undertake such a difficult task. Some topics just happen to capture our attention in ways that others do not. If we turn our attention towards these interests we will quickly discover the rich worlds that lie within them.
If the world that we find continues to intrigue us we will find our selves focusing more and more attention on this thing over time until we find ourselves obsessed. When we are obsessed with something it occupies us. Takes us over. We try to reclaim our thoughts but they are hijacked and led back to the obsession. Rehashing it. It’s not necessarily something that has to makes sense to us. Our attention always finding its way back to the topic. When it comes to Tricking, some are just drawn to it. If we’re being completely honest about it, most of us just wanted to be ninjas and power-rangers. We saw some film or tv series as a kid where people were doing some cool karate flips and we thought to ourselves. “Damn, thats cool”. Then we grew up and realized that real people can actually do these movements and we were hooked. 
Not to mention that once we started to learn about Tricking it becomes a real life video game. Where you are trying to level up this character (you) in order to access some of these higher tier moves. You are constantly trying to better various stats i.e. power, twisting, flexibility, endurance, technicality, and style. With the ability to min-max it however you see fit. Starting to “uncover” areas of the map as you explore. Learning how to do one thing opens up this new set of movements you can start to play with. You will constantly run into “boss battles”, problems that seem far more difficult to figure out, that will test your fortitude as you fail repeatedly. Often we get to these stages where we get stuck on something and we want to just walk away from it. This is where the obsession drives our attention back to the problem. It’s almost like we can’t escape it until it’s solved.
You’ll be sitting there, trying to focus on something, maybe at work or school, but instead of focusing on what’s going on in front of you, your attention will pull you into this silent world where you are reviewing your last session, making plans for the next one. Maybe dissecting the movements you will need to make adjustments to in order to land some new trick you’ve been chasing. Or planning out some combo with the Tricks you’ve learned, trying to find new ways of combining them. Suddenly hours have passed while you were daydreaming but ultimately you don’t mind. You are ready for the next session and that’s all that matters to us at the time. 
We will often restructure our lives around the gym session access if we have it. This is our time to finally enact all the things we’ve been daydreaming about, or at least try to. The session is training, and it’s difficult, but more than anything it’s fun, and as soon as it’s over we will be doing it all over again. Collecting the Tricks we want and exploring the areas that interest us as they are available. Occasionally trying to make our ways into more difficult areas of training that lie outside of our capabilities, constantly pushing at the boundaries of what is possible. Both what is possible for us as individuals, but also what is possible for the human body, how it can move, and how hard it can be pushed.

            <Title>Sessions - Structure</Title>
            <Text>One of the great things about Tricking is you can really train anywhere. There are all kinds of sessions, grass sessions, dirt sessions, tramp sessions, parking lot sessions, but the most important session is usually the gym session. The gym session takes place in a gymnastics gym where there is access to a plyometric spring floor. The plyo is typically a carpeted floor made of a thick foam resting on top of a plywood layer that is attached to evenly spaced springs. This type of floor is extremely beneficial in reducing the intensity of the impact the joints will feel when training in acrobatic movements. Gaining access to these gym sessions will quickly aide progress as you will be more willing to try difficult and challenging Tricks if you have a much safer environment to fail at them in. 
No matter where the Tricker goes to have their session they will encounter a similar experience. Sessions usually start off with some form of light stretching and warm up movements to get the body parts moving freely. This is more important the older you are in Tricking, in our younger years we may be able to get away with doing some simpler Tricks as a warm up and just jump straight into our session. However as we get older it is much more important that we take the time to stretch and get our joints moving in order to avoid injuries.
Once the body starts to feel like it can move around there are a few options. We can sum them up roughly with three modes. We have training, exploration, and Tricking. We will often go through all of these modes in the same session, although many times we will have one mode as an intended “focus” for the session. Training is when we are directed at achieving a particular move, there is a plan and we just have to put in the work. Exploration is when we the goal isn’t a particular move but rather we are focused on how multiple Tricks and movements work and play together, trying to discover a deeper understanding. Tricking is the mode we get into when we bring it all together. The focus is no longer on particular Tricks, instead the focus is on playing with movements from our arsenal of Tricks. The moves we have trained up to and/or discovered in our exploration. 
If this is a training session the tricker will have some plan of action. A trick, combo, or set of tricks that they are working towards. They may approach these by warming up with the prerequisite Tricks until they are comfortable enough to start attempting things outside of their current skill level. 
From the individuals perspective there tends to be a deep embodied focus that comes about in the session. Once a few moves have been thrown and we are starting to work on something that lies outside of our capabilities we will have to go through the process we described earlier in the book. That cyclical process of Attempt, Assess, Adjustment. Attempting things outside of our current ability can often bring up those mental barriers we mentioned. Forcing us to overcome fears and testing our strength. Iterating through this until we approach the realization we were after. In this case realization literally the making real of something we had previously imagined, or planned. Each attempt on the way a failure. That failure itself the solution. A failure, when you can identify the specific point that caused the failure, is a way for our attention to be drawn to the issue. Something that makes itself apparent as needing an update. This is where we come to terms with the fact that our model is lacking and we have to make some adjustment to it before the next attempt. 
This back and forth that we are doing in our heads isn’t the only interaction we are having at the session though. The world around is is constantly influencing us. Often times we are session-ing with other Trickers. These people will often give us information that we ourselves are seeming to miss. We may be iterating over the same failure without making any adjustments because we don’t realize what the issue is. When those around us point our attention to specific aspects of the experience that we had neglected it often opens up doors that, if gone through, lead directly to the realization of this Trick. In this case realization both the “A-Ha” moment of understanding as well as the literal making real through enacting that new found understanding.
	We encounter problems like this constantly in our daily lives. Where we are simply too close to the experience to get an accurate picture of the situation. It takes others drawing our attention to the bigger picture, or some specific detail that will influence our understanding in a much more impactful way. Something that in effect re-frames the problem in a way that we are more capable of tackling. 
In the case of Tricks there are countless routes to achieve the same set of movements. Some people will easily be able to follow other people’s tutorials and explanations to quickly achieve Tricks. While for others they will have to struggle to make each movement their own. Approaching it from unique ways that build upon their current level of understanding. Not the theoretical understanding that we have been developing throughout this book but the physical mind-body understanding that only comes from the direct experience in the individual. Some people are able to develop this mind-body connection very rapidly and extend it beyond their first hand experience. Their mental models are accurate enough to quickly make connections that for some need to be slowly built up to. This is that individual path to tricking showing itself again.
Regardless of which category the Tricker finds themselves in, the benefits from interacting with the other Trickers and spectators at a session is extremely important. The more constantly we are getting outside of our intimate relationship to these tricks. The more we will be able to accurately assess our shortcomings and make the proper adjustments to attain our goals. As well as discover new goals and take inspiration from the ways that other Trickers are moving in their Tricks.
When we have reached a point in our training where we have a few movements we have the ability to get into the exploration mode. When I say few, I literally mean 2 or more. If we have two different Tricks that we know, meaning we can consistently perform them. Let’s say hook kick and a cartwheel. We have enough to start exploring these Tricks and their relationships. We can do a cartwheel&gt;hook. We can hook&gt;cartwheel. We can do the hook while we are doing the cartwheel. Playing with the way that these movements can be put together both through Transitions as well as manipulating the Tricks themselves is what allows us to discover “new” Tricks. Things that exist in theory but haven’t been performed yet. Even if we only have a few of the most basic movements there are many Tricks that are available. 
The more we explore these movements, the faster we will be able to navigate through the training mode in the future and get into the Tricking mode. This is where it all comes together. After training specific Tricks and exploring how they interplay we have a skill-set that we have developed. An arsenal of tricks that can be called upon on demand. We can use these Tricks, Transitions, Variations and the style in which we do them like the Letters, Words, and Punctuation that make up the sentences, paragraphs, and chapters of this book. Each display having within it a meaning that extends beyond just the shapes and squiggles that it consists of. Tricking combos are that same display. A language that if you can hear it says much more than the words in isolation allow for. 
Tricking in the Tricking Mode is the same process as any artist engaging in their medium after they’ve reached a certain point of study. The understanding of the medium allows for something to be created that only the practitioner could envision and bring forth. Each creation something that is taking from and giving back to the culture from which it was created.
As we move through a session we will be constantly bouncing between these various modes of engaging with Tricking. Each of them necessary to the other. It isn’t just what we are engaging with movement wise that will affect our session. The session will change and morph throughout based on a variety of factors. The music, the tricks, the people, in general the tone. All of these factors will influence in different ways how the session will play out. 
Will you be able to focus on your goals during the session? Will the other Trickers help you realize those goals, or will they inspire you to play with completely different movements. Maybe we were planning on a more playful session, but everyone else is in training mode. Maybe its the other way round. Either way the dominant mode at a session can often be contagious.
We will often find ourselves feeding off the Tricks and energy of the other Trickers we are sessioning with. If other people are excited and bringing a lot of hype and energy to the session it will be easier for us to do the same. If, on the other hand, everyone at session is quietly working on something in their own worlds, we will typically find ourselves doing something similar. </Text>

            <Title>Performing a Hook Kick</Title>
            <Text>After learning all these terms and broken down pieces of the Trick we return to it with a new confidence. We think to ourselves: “With a more full understanding of what a hook kick is now we are surely ready to perform the move successfully. We know about all these fancy new terms and different ways of talking about the move. We’ve broken it down into all these simple steps and know the order they go in. We’ve studied loads of other peoples techniques and have figured out what movement patterns the best are using to get that consistency. We now have a much better map to go off when we are imagining ourselves performing this Trick. We are going to nail it for sure…” 
The imagined version of ourselves was performing this picture perfect rendition of the hook kick. Executing it well above our waist height, nearly eye level! It was perfect. It had a clear target, the target was spotted, kick chambered, executed, and re-chambered. Balance was maintained throughout the duration of the Trick and the body was in an upright position with great limb extension. The pivot happened naturally underneath the plant foot, like all the effortless looking videos we had been studying. Enter Reality. 
Unfortunately this is not what came out in our attempted execution. No, the reality was that of a leg flailing just a few inches above the ground, with a hunched over posture, hopping on the plant foot to try to maintain balance before falling over. There was no chamber, and definitely no re-chamber. The target was completely forgotten about and what the fuck was happening with our arms. This is not what we just planned in our heads. 
So we remind ourselves we need to break it down slowly. By focusing on each of the individual pieces of the move in isolation we can make those connections, developing our muscle memory so that when we attempt the whole thing again our body knows how to do it. There is a very focused attention that we discover in this process. A specific kind of perception called proprioception. Proprioception is the sense of self-movement and position of the body in space. Often referred to by people as air-awareness or body-awareness it is a sense that we will be developing and making great use of throughout our exploration of Tricking. 
This hook kick that we have broken down into parts, in theory, needs to then be broken down into parts, in practice. We typically start slowly moving our bodies through the attempt at a hook kick in a much slower way then the first times, paying attention to where the experience we are having isn’t matching up with the imagined version we have created. As we are doing these slow methodical movements we are paying close attention to the sensations our bodies are experiencing. Which muscles are tightening, which muscles are not doing what we ask, where is our flexibility causing us to fail? This back and forth of attention and questioning while we work through the movement is extremely important. This is the updating of those maps of the experience of the movement, with the imagined version we aim towards. We are learning what it feels like when we do particular things and how that affects the visual look of the movements of our body. 
This deep embodiment we are learning to experience, where there is a physical aspect of learning the interactions of these models, puts us in this very intense encounter with our shortcomings as they are literally felt within the body. The improvements that need to be made become apparent and must be addressed if we wish to make progress. Things like stretching to free up tightness; going through the movements of the trick regularly to build up a strength in the lacking muscles; and becoming familiar with the way these movements feel will all need to be done.
Each tricker is on a personal journey when it comes to each Trick. This means it may take one person only a few attempts to go through the process of getting the result they are after, while it could take another thousands. This could be based on the level of perfection these different Trickers are aiming for, or it could just be that some movements come more natural to one versus the other. This personal aspect of the journey of tricking will frustrate many as they are constantly comparing their progress over time to that of others. It doesn’t matter how quickly or slowly we achieve the next step, the reward tastes the same, Sweet and Delicious. 
At a certain point of us iterating these cyclical steps of attempt, assessment, and adjustment, we will find a certain experience of success. An attempt in which the physical experience approximately matches our imagined view which also approximates what we wanted it to visually look like. The experience of all these things lining up after many failures brings with it a sense of accomplishment and euphoria. We have finally done it! We set out to accomplish this difficult task of moving our bodies in this way and we achieved it! This sensation of pushing at a boundary of our capability, attempting this move, and having been successful, gives us this pride and a confidence to try something even more difficult. We are ready to explore tricking further!
So far we have been slowly zooming into more and more specific encounters the Tricker will have with Tricking and all of its inner workings, but we have been doing so from the point of view of learning one Trick which has relatively few components. We did so to experience firsthand just how complex and layered learning one trick can be. There are many terms which need to be learned and then mapped both mentally and physically. Those then need to be ordered, and applied with the right timing, all of which will come together in a successful execution of the movement.
Moving into the later sections we will start to see how each of these things complexify to become a very intense but still manageable system. As we build up our understanding we will find that seemingly intimidating movements can be broken down in the same way as we have just gone through.</Text>

            <Title>Anatomy of a Trick</Title>
            <Text>Before diving deeper into what we get from combining the elements of Kicking, Flipping and Twisting let’s briefly discuss the anatomy of a Trick. The anatomy of a trick is a way of breaking down the trick into more manageable chunks that contain information about the trick. Each of these &quot;sections&quot; are just ways to describe the trick and happen much more fluidly then the following description may imply. This framework can allow for a deeper understanding of how Tricks are being created and variated. 
*** Insert Graphic Anatomy of A Trick ***
 We have at the heart of it the base-trick, referred to here as the CoreTrick, this is a set of movements that meets the criteria to call it that name. The CoreTrick will also always have a Takeoff Stance and Takeoff Style as well as a Landing Stance and Landing Style. The Takeoff and Landing Stances denote the orientation to the Direction of Movement, while the Takeoff and Landing Styles refer to how many feet, in what order, and in which way. The CoreTrick itself can be broken down into five different sections that occur during the move. It has a Beginning Middle and End as you would expect, but it also has one more on either side of those, we will call them the Entrance and Exit to the CoreTrick. The Entrance is the very beginning of the Trick before any determining movement has been performed, this section will often be affected by the Takeoff Stance and Style. The Exit of the Trick is the very end of the Trick after all criteria for the CoreTrick has been met and the only thing left is completing the Landing Stance and Style for the next transition. Each of these various elements of the Trick can be variated by combining different movements into the various stages of the Trick. Once these pieces have been put all together we are given a new higher level Trick which can itself be put back into the process continuing to complexify it. 
All of the higher level Tricks are really just basic moves that were put through this process of variating the CoreTrick over and over again until something new and interesting came out of it. This also means that if there is any higher level move that you want to perform you just have to work up the basic moves and do the small variations along the way to eventually get there. The whole Tricking system is nothing more than a bunch of layers of simple movements that have been pushed to their limits!

            <Title>Culture</Title>
            <Text>Culture. A definition of this is often reduced down to the attitudes and behaviors that are characteristic of a particular social group or organization. While not entirely incorrect it offers these up as somewhat stagnant objects that are unchanging, as if we could list off these attitudes and behaviors in a short list and that would encompass the culture with which we reference. 
Lets take a deeper look at what culture really is and how it forms, or rather is forming, as this is a constant process that is unfolding with each interaction of the participants. First, the question, who or what establishes the culture in the first place. It’s hard to say. It’s not in effect one person who sets the culture, with the exception of a totalitarian one. It’s out of the interactions between the participants in the culture. And yes I would argue that a culture is not something you “belong” to but rather something you participate within. This culture comes out of the participation of multiple individuals with their own entirely unique world-views, each one taking and giving from the culture in their own ways. Whether the ideas, behaviors, interactions were reacted to positively or negatively will inform the participant how to adjust their behaviors. Each person constantly making adjustments to their behavior based on others responses. The social pressures can shift the culture to change rapidly, or stagnate it’s growth. 
So the first few people who begin to do a particular activity are the ones who establish the first “culture”. It is these participants general disposition towards each other, and the world in general that shapes what this culture consists of. Just as much as the people form the culture, the culture also forms the people. As we become ingrained in a particular subset of society, we will begin adopting manners of speaking, ways of looking at problems, new behaviors and in general a new lens to look at the world through. We learn the way the members of the group we want to fit into behave and we try to adapt ourselves to that. This isn’t to say that we completely abandon who we were before this. We bring that to this new culture. When we put our particular spin on a way of doing something we take note of how the other participants in the culture reacted. If this was positive then we will often watch other people begin to pull this behavior into their way of being, if it is negative we may make adjustments to the way we do things in order to avoid offending members of our peer group. 
So each person as they are becoming molded by this culture are themselves molding it back. It is through the iteration of the co-molding that actually establishes the culture. Effectively it is emergent. Each iteration taking new things into the culture and dispelling with others. The learning that one does in joining a particular sub-culture is basically how not to offend the other participants to the degree that they wouldn’t be welcomed back.
Some cultures are more rigid then others, where the have essentially established the norms and behaviors they have found to work and make a strong effort to discourage newer participants from going against these. Not necessarily totalitarian but approaching that direction organically through a distributed network of people correcting others through shame, rather than force. Others may encourage new behaviors and ideas to be explored and allowed to flourish, constantly bringing them into their culture and constantly allowing the “standards” to change. 
Tricking, finds itself in the latter category. Where the culture of today is hardly the culture of last week. There are some things that are consistent, but more has changed than hasn’t in the last decade. Tricking is constantly reifying its behaviors as it sees new updates. And it is thanks to each individual tricker that this is possible. Each person pushing their own boundaries within tricking, and exploring whatever areas they find exciting. Taking what they find and sharing it back with the rest of the community of participants to get feedback. New moves and combo “metas”. Meta here reffering to the gamer sense of the word meaning the generally agreed upon strategy for approaching a particular problem, or the M E T A. Most Effective Tactics Available. This just means the common way you see people putting their Tricks together in combos.
	This participatory aspect of culture is one that is often overlooked, and the responsibility shirked off. The problem is that when people ignore that how they interact with a culture in turn influences that culture. Especially when other members of that group consider that person as a resource of information about how the culture generally functions. Whether you wish to have an impact on something or not, you will. By simply interacting with it at all we are going to change it in some way. When we take the responsibility for this, we have the opportunity to direct back towards the culture as much positivity and growth as we can. We should most definitely do this in the cases where the culture that we have come into and been formed by has positively affected our own lives. 
That is in effect what this book is. An attempt to contribute something back to a culture that has given me so much. So many lessons I have learned through interacting with Tricking and all of its many participants. It is after realizing the importance of all these interactions that I’ve had and how they’ve shaped me and given me the opportunities I needed in order to learn certain lessons that I felt the compulsion to share something back to it. Something that hopefully will shift and change the culture forward into something new and greater than it was before. 
Just as we mentioned earlier how each individual Tricker will be on their own unique path through Tricking. Each individual Tricker will also  have their own unique contribution to Tricking and the tricking culture that makes it up.
In this life we are all each individuals with completely ways of approaching things, informed by our experiences before us and the goals that we strive for in front of us. Each with the ability to cultivate a unique expertise on one particular thing, what it is that we have to offer the world. We do this each day when we interact with things. It is by our very existence that we are constantly offering ourselves up to the world, and allowing our influence to be imbued on it. This is obviously felt more strongly in the smaller and smaller communities however this is a pattern that presents itself to us in many areas of our experience. The question is are we going to passively affect this culture or are we going to actively take part in its creation.</Text>

            <Title>What is Flow</Title>
            <Text>In the cases of many of the extreme sports activities, the uninitiated will sometimes use the term of adrenaline junkie to refer to people who do these things, but that is a bit of a misnomer. The people described by such a term aren’t after an adrenaline rush, not at all. The adrenaline only rushes in when things are starting to go wrong. What those people are actually addicted too is getting into the flow state.
There has been extensive research that has been done surrounding flow theory, as introduced in the 1970s by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, that outlines very well why Tricking has the benefits it does. Many of the fields that study human consciousness, psychology, cognitive psychology and behavioral sciences have further explored the initial ideas that Csiksszentmihalyi laid out in his various written works. 
Essentially the Flow Theory revolves around this concept of a Flow State. A flow state refers to the experiential sense of being an individual feels when engaging with certain tasks. Specifically the tasks that have them feeling, as well as performing their best. Flow theory is a descriptive model of the attributes that lead to the experience of these flow state. This descriptive model has led to a variety of prescriptive models in its wake. Specifically the field of Positive Psychology which directly came as a result of more and more people looking into the findings of Flow Theory.
Csikszentmihaly had originally set out to understand how people feel when they most enjoy themselves and why that was the case. He was basically interested in what happiness is, and whether or not it can be cultivated. What he found in this search was that people generally tended to describe a similar experience of flow. Most notable in his findings were the types of activities these individuals were engaged in when these feelings arose. More often than not the activities they described were not leisure activities, but rather activities that had them engaging in some difficult tasks. Participants in the study would often describe the times of highest enjoyment as those when they were engaged in solving difficult problems often times in terms of their professional work.
The term flow state derives from the many interviews Csikszentmihalyi conducted where participants described their optimal state of performance as instances where their actions seemed to flow from one to the next. Or in the case of artisans, the work seemed to flow out of them with little effort. Participants often describe a sense of timelessness and that every tasks seems almost effortless and things just “come together”. 
As he studied these flow states he developed a generalized list of the conditions that accompany flow. Typically these flow inducing activities have (1) Clear Goals with a distinctively defined objective and immediate feedback, (2) the performers skills are adequately suited for the challenge, (3) during the activity the performers action and awareness merge, (4) the perfomer has a deep concentration on the task at hand, (5) the performer experiences the potential for control, but not a certainty, (6) the performer may experience a loss of their sense of self, a sense of growth, or a connection to something bigger than themselves, (7) an altered sense of time, where it may appear to pass slower or faster than usual, and (8) the experience itself becomes a goal in itself, it is auto-tellic.
It is not required that an experience contain all 8 of these conditions, nor is this an exhaustive list of all of the possible experiences that accompany a flow state. It is however a great general starting point for understanding what a flow state is and why people pursue them. Initially it was thought that these experiences were reserved for a certain subset of society to enjoy, only the best at their particular task could ever really be “in the zone”. Over time though, there was a realization that a diverse range of activities engender this experience, and at a vast range of skill levels.
It was a long held belief that these types of “peak experiences” were only available as a reward for operating at an elite level. As Csikzentmihalyi, and the many who followed him, discovered these “peak experiences” felt in these flow states were actually the very thing that would lead someone to eventually operate at an elite level. It wasn’t chasing being the best that made them the best, it was having a love for the activity that brought them back to train in it over and over until they eventually developed the skills.

            <Title>Self-Teaching</Title>
            <Text>	Tricking is always unique to the individual who is participating. In order for someone to interact with it they will constantly be having to teach themselves ways of doing things. Overcoming difficult barriers that may not exist for others. This self-teaching aspect of Tricking is one of it's greatest tools. The realization that any complex system can be sufficiently understood if approached in smaller chunks and slowly brought back into the understanding of the whole. At first the things that seem overwhelming actually turn into rich worlds available to explore.
	Having a model of how to teach ourselves that we can reference moving forward allows for us to pick up on tasks much quicker. By understanding the base pattern of Establish Domain, Identify Skills Needed, Learn Process to perform, Attempt to Perform, Identify Weakness, Expand knowledge in area, Re-attempt, Identify Weakness, Expand Knowledge in area, Re-attempt. Iterating over these steps until we achieve the desired results. 
	This cyclical pattern of Attempt, Assess, Adjust is one that will serve us for the rest of our lives. Having a willingness to continue iterating when the initial results ended in failure. The ability to recognize the failures for what they are, weakness identifiers, and use that to make the correct changes. Improving in anything is as simple as these three steps. They may take slightly different forms but in some way it is at its core. Attempt, Assess, Adjust. 
	The ability to interface with any domain and rather quickly be able to start identifying areas where you can begin to focus in on is extremely useful. Autodidacts, or those who can teach themselves, can quickly learn things that interest them. Learning many different things the autodidact may be able to make contributions to multiple areas by bringing in perspectives from the other domains they are well versed in. This isn't to say that the person will necessarily have the same expertise as the specialist within each domain. No, what we are saying here is that the generalist just may be able to provide a different viewpoint or framework for the specialists to operate within. Offering opportunities for the specialists to take a closer look at some of the things they might have missed.
	Self-teaching as a tool that we have is also something that will constantly be paying us back by engaging with it. As we learn more things about different domains we start making connections between the various domains we have studied so far. These connections are exactly the types of things we mentioned before that can potentially benefit the specialists. Seeing the patterns that are present across multiple domains is also useful to us as we start to realize the order that exists within this chaos. The semi consistent ways of organization that take place in so many different areas and at many levels of abstraction. 
	The more we understand about the world the more we will realize how little we understand as humans and how much potential still lies just beyond our reach. The infinite curiosity that can be fed by exploring the areas we find still unmapped can also lead to our contribution to society by helping build the map. Learning many different skills is the best way for us to get a sample of whats out there and have a diverse background for when we do find the thing that obsesses us. The question that we need the answer to, and if no one else has answered it yet, we will find the answer. Each one of us has something that will create this in us. Each one different from the next. It's this that we have to offer the world. Our obsessions should be driving our productivity in a way that we can't wait to get back to work on our projects. The society that could exist if we had more people with this attitude is beyond our greatest dreams.

            <Title>Barrier To Entry</Title>
            <Text>Tricking is strange in that it has a relatively high barrier to entry however the retention rate is surprisingly high for those who do get into it. You either love tricking with a fiery passion or you couldn’t care less about it. It’s almost as if Tricking finds us and pulls us into it and holds us there until we find ourselves immersed in this underground world of real life ninjas and super humans.
 As we’ve seen by going through the terminology and technicals section, Tricking is rather complex. It has many things that are difficult to fully understand how they work together without taking the time to develop a deep understanding of the system. But once we start developing that understanding, exceptional worlds of possibility open up before us. We see areas that, while they have been mapped, have not been truly explored physically, first hand. All of the theory needs to be made real through our actions. There is so much that tricking has to offer once we get over that initial barrier of trying to figure out what it is, and start realizing what it can do.
Sometimes the simplest starting rules can lead to emergent systems that appear to take on their own life. Take John Conway’s Game of Life. This is a cellular automaton computer program that has only a few simple rules. It contains a grid of cells which abide by the following rules to control their state. 
1. Any live cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by loneliness. 
2. Any live cell with four or more cells dies, as if by overpopulation. 
3. Any live cell with two or three neighbors survives. 
4. Any dead cell with three neighbors comes alive, as if born.
Which can be simplified even further to three rules.
1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
2. Any Dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
3. All others cells die, or stay dead in the next generation

*** Insert Images of John Conways Game of Life***
Out of these few simple rules an immense amount of potential patterns can be displayed. It all depends on the starting conditions. Each of which can lead to a variety different end results over just a few iterations, even from extremely similar initial conditions. Some of the patterns may lead nowhere, while others may create very stable patterns that continue over many generations.
	This is something you will quickly realize within Tricking. Once you understand a few of the rules to operate within, entire worlds of complexity are immediately opened up to be investigated. It’s this feature that really hooks us. We don’t have to learn all of Tricking to really engage with this system. We can choose to find the areas that excite us about it the most and spend the majority of our time within those areas. Exploring it in a way that only we can. 
That is the magic that lies just beyond that barrier to entry. Rich worlds of complexity and emergence from simple rules. For those of us who do make it past that barrier, lifetimes worth of exploration can be found.       And once they are found they grab hold of our interest and set us on a new path. </Text>

            <Title>Moreness</Title>
            <Text>	We spend so much of our lives learning how to label and categorize things into distinct little boxes. Each category an organized set that has things that go in it and things that dont. Each label giving us some word with an associated description of what its referring to. We take all these labels and the categories they fit within and use them to build up a model of the world. 
	This model we are building is always an approximation. A reference to the way things were &quot;the last time we checked&quot;. It contains only the things we have encountered in it. Only the things we thought were necessary to build a sufficient model to move through the world. We do this is because dealing with everything the world has to throw at us at one point would be overwhelming. So we use these models to orient ourselves towards reality in a way that we can map ourselves to it accurately enough.
	In doing so we are constantly throwing out information, reducing and simplifying extremely concept things in the world down to often single words or short phases in order to talk and think about them. This is extremely useful when we want to have a conversation. Having broad strokes to paint the world with allows us to quickly know which categories we can ignore when we are trying to solve some problem. Which when you reduce it down is fundamentally all we do as humans. We solve problems. 
	The issue with this is the fact that we do it so often that its easy for us to forget that these models we have built up about the world are lacking. They are old versions of the way the world was, not the way it is, and is becoming. Reality is an ever changing system that only really &quot;patterns&quot; its processes. Our models are really only close enough for us to make decent predictions. Those predictions becoming more accurate the more often we are making updates to those models and adding new information into the categories and labels we are using. 
	This process of modeling is one that typically goes on in the background rarely having our attention turned directly upon it. Tricking puts us in a position where the models we are building are constantly out of date as each attempt brings a new variable into the equation. Our attention is forced upon this breakdown of model to reality. Patterns of behavior that we had previously used to model the world are not accurate enough for us to enact what we are attempting. 
	Having our attention turned upon this process allows us to adjust how we are creating these models rather than letting them automatically update themselves based on our experiences. When we take part in this process we have the control. We can influence our patterns of reaction in different ways. 
	Typically in our automatic processing of this model our behaviors become ingrained without us noticing. We end up missing out on so much of the reality we just confronted. When we take this process into our own hands however, we are exploring more of what we encountered. Picking and choosing for ourselves which pieces of information are actually relevant for us on the next attempt. This means we have to figure out ourselves which information is actually relevant. It's a difficult process. One that can be quite frustrating at times. However when we do finally get that model tweaked the way we need it, something amazing happens. 
	The feedback loop we create is one that is constantly monitoring itself, not passively, but with an active reflection stage. Each time we make an attempt we take a careful stock of what just happened and how far off it was from what our goal was. We then take these points and try to come up with the quickest route to get us from where we are to where we are trying to go. Identifying which elements are currently preventing us from progressing towards this ideal.

            <Title>Initial Encounter</Title>
            <Text>Tricking has a way of making you think it’s one thing while being another. The best way to understand this is to go through some of the processes that we might find ourselves in throughout the journey to understanding Tricking as a participant. It starts with a first encounter. 	You’re watching as someone is running and it seems like they’re about to jump and do something but you have no idea what. As your curiosity peaks, you see one leg leave the ground, swinging upward in the air with arms flailing towards the sky as the other leg jumps to match it, as they lift into the air they contort into themselves in a way that generates a spin. The person is now upside down flying through the air, flipping and rotating around themselves in a way that can only end in a crash to the head, but as you continue to watch, they unfurl their bodies while hurtling towards the ground, repositioning with their feet underneath to land only to continue moving seamlessly into the next display of acrobatics, with seeming control and grace, yet a raw unfettered power being released.  
The first time we see someone catapulting their body in utter defiance of gravity, moving in this complex fury of precision and confusion, and coming to rest upright and uninjured at the end is something to say the least.  When we see this, a number of different thoughts will cross the mind: impossible, dangerous, marvelous, stupid, talented, I could never do that, those people are crazy, and usually, what did I just watch.
For most of us the first time we see such a thing we have absolutely no idea of what we just witnessed. The main thing we remember is that we expected one thing to happen and something else did. We expected a crash, but the person landed, we expected it to stop when they hit the ground with their feet but they kept going into another movement. We expected something but what was in front of us was something altogether different. Being confronted with this can be too much to make sense of for many, and it often simply stops there. A quick applause or shocked reaction, some utterance of amazement, and then we move on. We keep walking through the park continuing our conversation, or skip to the next video about something else. We get back to our lives and file what we saw under the category of novel, unique or peculiar and don’t think about it again. It’s easier that way.
For a few of us, however, an intrigue grows. We find ourselves in amazement and deep curiosity about what we have witnessed and want to discover more about it. We begin to immerse ourselves in the content. Watching, and rewatching, every video that we can get our eyes on where these people are seeming to defy gravity in these complex ways, using nothing but their bodies. As we consume all this content, a mental map of terms starts to be formed. We start learning the jargon this group uses to communicate about the particular activities they engage in. 
Learning this structure and the various interplays of these terms doesn’t happen all at once. It might go something like this. You’re watching these videos simply taking in all of the amazing feats of the human body when some movement or set of movements grabs your attention and pulls you in. You pause the video and go back to rewatch it. You repeat this a few times. “What is this move called…” you start wondering to yourself, “Is this even possible? If it is possible… Can I learn this? What IS this?”  
Depending on what era you came into Tricking, the specifics may vary, but in general you most likely went through a similar process of discovery. You started by searching Google for “Tricking”, “Tricking Tutorials”, “How to Trick”, “Tricking Moves”, or something to that effect. As you explored the various websites and videos a simple model began to develop. A basic map with various representations that have relationships with other representations. You started creating this crude map using the various terms you saw people using to describe the moves they were performing. The terms are then associated within the mental model with the particular movement that is being performed and you now have a rudimentary understanding of what a particular Trick is called and what it looks like when it is performed. As you repeat this process learning more of the terms, the relationship between the terms are put into more and more context as the total map of other terms are understood. 
Some of this language contains words we already understand in some context from other encounters we’ve had with movement based sports. Things like Flips, Roundoffs/Cartwheels, Rotations, Kicks, etc… These are fairly easy to fit into the model. Other things have their own proprietary bend that is unique to the Tricking community, and sometimes unique to local areas within the Tricking community. Things like Cork, Shuriken, Swipe, Hyper, Mega, Semi, Swing, Scoot, etc… Some of these words could be recognizable however within the context of Tricking they take on a whole new signification and are, possibly, a little difficult to understand at first glance. 
After a few hours of google searching, browsing forums, and the various websites that have attempted to create a Tricktionary, (dictionary of terms commonly used within Tricking) you finally find the one thing you began looking for 4 hours ago that you had completely forgotten about as you became increasingly lost down this rabbit hole. Whether you explore down this rabbit hole for a few hours or for a few months before you attempt to perform any of these moves yourself makes absolutely no difference to what will happen when you attempt them. What happens next is a similar experience for most Trickers. 
At this point we have some mental representation of a movement set, that we have seen someone else perform, and we have labeled accordingly with the terminology used by the community of practitioners. Our understanding of this Trick we now want to attempt to perform ourselves seems sufficient for us to envision the possibility of ourselves actually performing such a feat. We then take that imagined experience. One that we have created based on a perception and interpretation of the things we have seen others do in order to perform this particular movement. We then try our best to embody that experience we have just conjured. 
If you hadn’t realized yet this is becoming a really bad game of telephone. One where we have the first hand experience of the move being converted into an approximate understanding, by someone who doesn’t understand what is going on, using other people to give an approximate description of what the move entails. That we then take that approximation and try to make it our own by imagining what it would be like to do that thing before we try to perform it. At this point it has been converted several times, each one further and further from the reality of the movement. Much like in a game of telephone, when the message finally gets to where its going, it is very different from what it began as. 
When we go to perform the move ourself, the first thing we are confronted with as we begin this attempt is that we don’t know where to start or how to move our bodies. Suddenly the extremities that have been a part of us throughout the entirety of our being alive; Things that were uniquely ours and always understood what we wanted, whether it was to walk, or drink something, or open a door. These extremities always just behaved the way we intended, and that was the end of the conversation. However here, something notable takes place. We are confronted with a breakdown in how to move a particular body part to achieve what we intend. We have to go all the way back to the beginning of how do I move my legs in the space around me. How do I use my arms to balance me when I’m moving other body parts. A deep intentional connection has to be rebuilt, because all of a sudden the map we have of our bodies has just been shown to be extremely lacking. 
This jarring encounter sets us upon a new path of understanding the way that we embody our intention to move in a particular way. How we communicate with our own bodies is something that has to be explored and understood if we have an intention of getting anywhere on our journey to achieve this Trick that we “thought” we were ready to perform. A mountain of work has amassed itself in front of us and we are faced with a choice. Is this project, the one of learning this Trick, or learning any Tricking for that matter, something we are going to continue to undertake? 
For some the intrigue that grew past the initial stage is set to die here. It’s not to say they weren’t capable of overcoming such boundaries and challenges that have been laid out. Rather, that the project no longer compels their interest in the same way. Those of us who still have something drawing us towards this really don’t have a choice in the matter. The project in its complexity has a deep intrigue that takes over our mental space. When our minds wander it wanders back towards Tricking.

            <Title>Terminology Babble</Title>
            <Text>To understand these better lets take a look at how we build things up starting with the Backflip, Frontflip and Sideflips. Each of these Tricks only contain one of the categories with which we described Tricking as a whole, that is, the category of flips. These are some of our base “moves” that make up the “move-set” that contains all of the Tricks. Each of these has a directionality to them meaning they exist within an oriented framework where up and down and forward and back have been decided by your DOM. Now, if you remember from earlier our DOM refers to our Direction of Momentum and just means the direction we are traveling in space parallel to the ground, i.e. front to back, left to right, etc. 
These terms are actually just sets of movement criteria that fall within a particular category, that of somersault moving in x direction. In the case of backflips its the backwards direction. Frontflips, front direction, and you guessed it, Sideflips meaning from Side to Side (Right to Left or Left to Right). In any of these cases we can see how the information is built in and tells us what we need to know to frame the Trick being referenced. 
You also have your variations on these, changing how many hands or feet are touching the ground throughout the Trick. Tricks such as Backflip, Frontflip, and Sideflip, have one footed equivalents the Gainer, Webster, Aerial, respectively. GrandMasterSwipe (GMS), Lotus, and Raiz are also one footed variations with no hands touching down in the move but these look less like there Flipping counterparts as they incorporate some degree of Torsion to the body. Torsion in this case meaning that the Knees Hips and Shoulders are twisting at slightly different rates. There is no “true” rotation in these Tricks although there appears to be. 
The ability for us to twist through three different cores of twisting at different rates allows for some interesting shapes to be created when these are out of sync. In typical twisting when you are trying to accomplish a Full twist you want these cores to be mostly twisting at the same rate, however in some cases varying this ratio can allow for the body to achieve positions that are very unconventional in everyday movement.  
There are also moves such as Backandspring, Fronthandspring, Cartwheel, Gumbi, and Reversao that incorporate two hands touching the ground in the Trick and takeoffs or landings typically with Two Feet however occasionally with one. Moves such as Valdez, TouchDown Raiz(Left Hand), Broken Raiz (Right Hand) are all variations that incorporate only one hand touching down during the middle of the Trick. 
When we add rotation to these flips we typically do so in 360 degree increments calling that a single, or full rotation. This leaves the 180 degree rotations to be designated as halves. For example, backhalf, fronthalf, and sidehalf, refer to 180 degree rotations in a backward, frontwards, or sidewards directions respectively. The Full 360 degree rotation then gives us Backfull, often just referred to as Full as this is the default DOM, as well as Frontfull, and Sidefull. Two 360 degrees add to 720 degrees giving us Doubles, and if we add one more 360 degrees that brings us to 1080 degrees with the Triples. This is the most we will need for most things but it should be noted that there are people who have added another 360 degrees to bring us to a total of 4 spins at 1440 degree of rotation. While this is extremely rare and currently performed only by the top athletes within Tricking, I don’t think it will be long before the elites will be adding another one or two spins and the average tricker will be able to Triple or even Quad. Tricking has a funny way of progressing like that. 
When we are adding rotation to kicks the naming convention is a little different. In the case of vert kicking, tricks are most commonly referred to by their degree of rotation. Utilizing each half rotation starting with 180 degrees moving through 360, 540, 720, 900, 1080, 1260, 1440, 1620.
 If you are using TKT, you would use the actual in-air rotation to define all backside, or frontside pop or swing kicks, however in the case of cheat kicks an additional 180 degrees is always added to account for the stance change performed in the cheat. This means TKT will be describing from when you begin the trick the total rotation reached. For example, backside540round and swing540round and cheat 720 round all have 540 degrees of in air rotation in them. We can also see from the designation of round that these all contain a round kick. Moves such as cheat900hook, backside720hook, swing 720hook show us their rotation as well as that they contain hook kicks. 
Mainstream takes a different approach to naming kicks that doesn't have any true convention it's more of a tradition passed down. Things like cheat9, backside9(pop9), swing9, all stand for 900, however these kicks only have 540 degrees of in-air rotation the same as the kicks discussed before in TKT terms. It is typically up to the individual which terminology they want to use to describe kicks although it should be noted most people who understand TKT can also translate that into the corresponding mainstream term for sake of conversation.</Text>

            <Title>Simple Trick Breakdown: Hook Kick</Title>
            <Text>Let’s say we decide we want to learn a more “basic” Trick like a hook kick. A hook kick can be explained briefly by saying that it is a kick performed at or above waist height where the heel of the foot leads across the target in its direction of travel. Seems simple enough. In order to perform this move we make the assumption that we simply, pick a leg and move it in the air across an invisible target with our heel side going across it first. Then we go attempt this move. A number of things could happen but they will most likely share a commonality, that is, it wasn’t what we wanted to happen. Our first attempt could result in a messy flail of a limb randomly in the air; it could be an aggressive extension of the leg that takes us off our feet, such that we find ourselves on our ass confused; it could be that we have an aggressive tightness in certain muscles we just tried to use for the first time. No matter which of these it was, it definitely didn’t look like the people who have been doing them for a long time. So what is it that those people are doing differently? 
We set out to learn the things they already know. We may go through this process on our own by studying many of the best at this particular movement and try to mimic the movements they are doing. Often stopping the video and watching it frame by frame to better understand how they are creating the movement that we desire. Going through the motions ourself while trying to build up a &quot;mental picture&quot; of how this move unfolds. Or we may learn about the various parts of the kick and how other people have broken them down into their parts and isolated movements that are more manageable to learn. That another way to describe a hook kick is by establishing a few more terms to use to refer to its pieces. Elements that give us ways of orienting ourselves within specific sections of the Trick in order to know when and how to transition into the next. Some of these terms are things like Target, Direction of Movement (DOM), Spotting, Chambering, Re-chambering, Pivoting.
The Target is where in space the kick is supposed to be executed across, it is typically a point determined by the Direction of Movement (DOM). The DOM is the direction the body is traveling parallel to the ground. It sets the orientation of a Trick or series of Tricks within a 3d space. The Tricker will usually decide, based on what feels more natural, to twist a particular way. Either to their left or to their right. The average person defaults to twisting to their left, however some of the best Trickers in the world twist to the right. Either way the orientation within the DOM gets established in terms of this rotational proclivity. In order to perform the hook kick when twisting to the left it establishes that we must use our Left foot in order to accomplish the goal of leading with our heel-side. This also, in turn, establishes where the Target will be within our orientation. We will want to know where our kick is supposed to be executed which is where spotting comes in. Spotting allows us to visualize where the invisible target is in reference to ourselves, before, during, or after we execute the kick, as needed. We learn that Chambering is the act of doing a form of pseudo kick or a preparatory position of the limb before it actually executes the kick, most of the time resulting in a sort of knee bent version of the kick. Re-chambering is the act of bringing that limb back into the Chambered position after the execution of the kick across the Target is complete. Pivoting is a way of manipulating our feet underneath of us to maintain balance as we are shifting into different body positions throughout the execution of the Hook Kick.
So then the description of a hook kick becomes a bit more complex and a bit more accurate. A Hook Kick  is then a kick which is executed at or above waist height where the heel of the foot leads across the Target in its DOM. The kick is Chambered, extended outwards across the Target, which has been Spotted and then Re-chambered during which the planted foot may Pivot to maintain balance. 
With these new terms we have an easy way of breaking it up into those pieces that can be figured out slowly. Establish DOM; Establish Target; Spot Target; Chamber: Pivot; Spot Target; Kick; Pivot; Re-Chamber; Spot Target. These actions become much easier to execute then attempting to run through the whole thing at once. Developing these muscle memories and associating them with the terms used within the Tricking communities allows for these ideas to “make sense” to us by breaking it up into more manageable pieces.  These pieces then allow us to form a more enhanced understanding of the Trick within our mental maps and all their interweaving threads. 
With all this new information we have received we can then attempt to imagine ourselves performing this move. Going through each of the pieces we have broken it down into, in our minds. Imagining a version of ourselves creating those same movements with our own bodies. The enhanced details of this imagined experience give us a renewed sense of confidence. A feeling that we “might” be able to actually accomplish this goal we have set out for. Not a certainty, but a bold confidence in a maybe; one that will push us to try it again since the last botched attempt. ***INSERT GRAPHIC DOM Orientation***</Text>

            <Title>Intro</Title>
            <Text>If you are reading this it means that you or someone that you care about has become interested in something called, “Tricking”. You (or they) most likely are trying to understand more fully what this thing is and what, if any, importance it has. I will do my best to keep things as explicit as possible and not leave too many descriptions to be understood only by those who have experienced them first hand, although there is no substitute for first-hand experience. 
Letter to the Trickers
First I feel it’s important to state that you’re not crazy for not being able to explain why this thing is remarkable, when you know, down to your core, there is something deeper here that evades communication. Some things tap into a different part of human experience that step outside of our typical categorical ways of describing the world. Language becomes the barrier to sharing the way you feel about it. It becomes ineffable. Sometimes it may feel like it would be easier to take the feeling out of your chest and give it to the person you are talking with so they can just experience it themselves to understand. Unfortunately for us it’s not quite that easy, that feeling isn’t a tangible thing, no matter how viscerally concrete it may seem to us.
To every one:
I hope the following pages give you some insight into the inner workings of Tricking, what it is, how it became that way, and why it becomes an obsession to many. Not only that but in some way I hope you have a better understanding of it’s importance and potential to be useful in a world you do understand (to some degree).
So what’s the book about?
We will explore Tricking. How we discover it. The problems it creates, and the ones it solves. We will be going over several of the tricks themselves. The ways they interact with one another. How they can combine in new synergistic ways; opening up our understandings of the Tricking “movement set” and giving birth to new movements and styles of movements. I will be focusing mostly on the technical and underlying aspects and less of the accomplishments of individuals throughout Tricking “History” in the following contents. While the “History” is extremely important I do not feel it is my place to try to depict that here.
I will also be going over the aspects of the Tricking Community and why the elements that it has are especially conducive to creating a positive environment for creative growth and pushing boundaries. We will explore the underlying psychological elements of Tricking and how they can be utilized in every day tasks for the rest of your life. We will discuss both the upsides and the downsides of completely immersing yourself in the tricking culture and, how to transition to a position of balance with Tricking when you have “responsibilities” popping up around you. 
Leveraging the tools that Tricking can afford us, we can become better, more creative, more collaborative, more open, and more supportive people. Only if we are diligent in how we engage with this amazing and wonderful thing can we truly realize the benefits, because like all things Tricking has it’s downsides as well. A great quote from Paracelsus that shows this idea well is the following: sola dosis facit venemum (Only the dose makes the poison). Which is even more simply summed up with the Circa Survive lyrics “The only difference between medicine and poison is the dosage” and that fact is true of our beloved Tricking and all of it’s many amazing attributes. 
There is an occasion in life for most every activity, the important thing is knowing when it’s time to do what. I am a firm believer that you are the only person capable of making those determinations. Unfortunately for many of us we struggle with knowing how to make the right ones, and struggle even more with wondering if the other decision would have been better. If you know how to leverage Tricking’s toolbox in your life, it is my belief that there is absolutely nothing, that, if you truly set your mind (and body) to it, you would not be able to achieve. 
Tricking fills us with a sense of pride and accomplishment in things WE have done. It builds a foundation of successes under us and shows us new perspectives of looking at things. It teaches us to teach ourselves in ways that “we” understand. There is a sense of independence but also of community, of competition but also camaraderie. Tricking has the balance of opposites that together tug at each other and create between them this phenomenal opportunity for something new and different to emerge. It is a constant making and breaking of rules. It is a pattern present in all domains and if you learn to apply the pattern to different parts of your life. It will all be Tricking. All the activities that you may find yourself interested in will contain within them many of the elements that make Tricking so special to us.</Text>

            <Title>Exploring Tricking</Title>
            <Text>	What we are about to attempt is going to be a bit like trying to learn calculus starting with an elementary school math level. Which means we are going to need to build up layers upon layers of understanding. What we should try to take away from this section is not necessarily every term itself but rather the way that these terms are interacting with each other within this system. It takes many people years to fully understand some of the concepts we will be covering, so the reader can take solace in simply being able to take away the general gist. 
	As we've mentioned before there are a multitude of paths through Tricking. We can effectively start from any movement and move our way throughout the system to build up a picture of what it has to offer. For the tricker discovering this organically they will always explore the areas that excite them the most. Once they have picked the Trick they want to learn they dive into that Internet rabbit hole and quickly learn that in order to do the move they want, they should probably learn how to do a list of other tricks first. These prerequisites aren't hard and fast rules, however it's a pretty good bet that if you cannot do the &quot;pre-reqs&quot; you will have an extremely difficult time trying to learn this harder Trick. 
	So we start with this crazy ideal. Let's say it was wanting to learn how to do a boxcutter. We would first need to learn that a boxcutter is a corkscrew hyper hook. A corkscrew is a gainerfull done off axis. A gainer full is a gainer with a full twist. A gainer is a backflip off one leg. So in order to land a boxcutter. We would have to be able to hook kick, backflip, gainer, corkscrew, cork-hyper, and then put it all together in one movement. 
	It's a bit like unpacking a russian nesting doll where you just keep finding a smaller one inside of a smaller one. This is the same process we were discussing in the section about learning a hook kick. One where we go through each of the elements that make this thing up and divide them into more manageable movement chunks. If we take a look a the way we just broke up the boxcutter into its pieces we can take each of those movements and break them down in the same way we did with hook kick. Breaking down each move further and further to understand them allows us to see what makes them up and how those elements are combined together. Hopefully by now you are starting to get a loose feel for the way in which Tricking builds upon itself. </Text>

            <Title>Obsession =BrainDump</Title>
            <Text>When we are obsessed with something it occupies us. Takes us over. We try to reclaim our thoughts but they are hijacked and led back to the obsession. Rehashing it. It’s not necessarily something that has to makes sense to us. Our attention always finding its way back to the topic. When it comes to Tricking, some are just drawn to it. If we’re being completely honest about it, most of us just wanted to be ninjas and power-rangers. We saw some film or tv series as a kid where people were doing some cool karate flips and we thought to ourselves. “Damn, thats cool”. Then we grew up and realized that real people can actually do these movements and we were hooked. 
Not to mention that once we started to learn about Tricking it becomes a real life video game. Where you are trying to level up this character (you) in order to access some of these higher tier moves. You are constantly trying to better various stats i.e. power, twisting, flexibility, endurance, technicality, and style. With the ability to min-max it however you see fit. Starting to “uncover” areas of the map as you explore. Learning how to do one thing opens up this new set of movements you can start to play with. You will constantly run into “boss battles”, problems that seem far more difficult to figure out, that will test your fortitude as you fail repeatedly. Often we get to these stages where we get stuck on something and we want to just walk away from it. This is where the obsession drives our attention back to the problem. It’s almost like we can’t escape it until it’s solved.
You’ll be sitting there, trying to focus on something, maybe at work or school, but instead of focusing on what’s going on in front of you, your attention will pull you into this silent world where you are reviewing your last session, making plans for the next one. Maybe dissecting the movements you will need to make adjustments to in order to land some new trick you’ve been chasing. Or planning out some combo with the Tricks you’ve learned, trying to find new ways of combining them. Suddenly hours have passed while you were daydreaming but ultimately you don’t mind. You are ready for the next session and that’s all that matters. 
We will often restructure our lives around the gym session access if we have it. This is our time to finally enact all the things we’ve been daydreaming about, or at least try to. The session is training, and it’s difficult, but more than anything it’s fun, and as soon as it’s over we will be doing it all over again.

            <Title>Glossary</Title>
            <Text>Aeriform: (AeriformMAT.com) Dan Perez TeJada’s system of understanding, learning, and teaching. This is the basis for many concepts widely used within the Tricking community however it does vary from some of the more mainstream naming conventions. 

Anatomy of a trick: a way to break a Trick down into its constituent parts and a framework for building new unique tricks. Contains Takeoff Stance, Takeoff Style, CoreTrick, Landing Style, Landing Stance and Variations. It breaks a trick down into 5 parts Entrance, Beginning, Middle, End, and Exit. 

Ambi: Short for ambidextrous. This generally refers to the ability to perform a given trick on both sides, but can also mean the ability to do a trick on the opposite side, See Darkside. 

BackFlip: a somersault performed in the air in the backward direction

Backswing: takeoff in which the performer’s leg travels from back to front in a pendulum motion, similarly to kicking a ball with an exaggerated follow through. This is typically used to initiate back flipping motions such as gainers and corkscrews.  Often just labeled Swing.

Backside (Stance):  a stance in which the performer’s DOM is going directly behind them with the target at 90 degrees from there DOM in their default direction of rotation. Hips will be perpendicular. Left Twisters put the target to the Left, Right Twisters put the target to the Right. See Visual Glossary for further clarification.

Backside Complete (Sub-Stance): a stance in which the performer is in Backside with their Complete leg touching the ground. Left for Left Twisters, Right for Right Twisters. 

Backside Hyper (Sub-Stance):  a stance in which the performer is in Backside with their Hyper Leg touching the ground. Right for Left Twisters. Left for Right Twisters. 

Beginning: the initiating phase of the coretrick, happens after the Entrance and is when the movements that begin to define the Trick are made. 

Blocking: a term used to describe the transfer of linear momentum into a vertical lift. In many cases, the mission of the block is to translate all of the lateral momentum into lift, maintaining the energy but directing it upwards to use for height in inversion moves, or alternatively converting it into vertical rotation for vert kicking moves.

Boxcutter: corkscrew hyperhook, a corkscrew that is over-rotated and lands in Hyper stance while executing an outside kick (hook) with the alternate leg.  

Boneless: a variation on a vanish transition. Most often seen when transitioning from a hyper landing into a cork without changing the line of momentum. Boneless can be thought of as half a swing (specifically the last half starting from in front of the plant leg).  

Bound:  any unified transition that contains an additional stance adjustment step before taking off again. This adjustment step or hop can be used to change the stance we are in. See Unified Transitions

Butterfly Kick: a move with wushu origins, the bkick is similar to an aerial but performed on the horizontal axis with added flat spin. A bkick is dipped into with the chest and an arc is created with the jumping feet switching in air. 

Butterfly Twist: similar to an aerial twist but with a different flipping axis and added flatspin. A variation of a butterfly kick performed with an additional 360 degree rotation performed during the middle of the trick

Carrythrough: any swingthrough that has an additional stance change on the ground. either from Complete - Mega, Mega - Complete, or Hyper - Semi, Semi - Hyper.  

Cart: a term referring to two hands touching the ground during the middle of a trick in a sequential, L&gt;R or R&gt;L, pattern. Taken from the cartwheel this hand-touch variation can be applied to any invert trick.

Cartwheel: an inside or outside flip performed where the hands touch sequentially in the middle. The performer in effect does a wheel with their body. Bringing their hands to the floor one at a time as the body inverts. The legs travel over the body while one or both hands are on the ground, and then the feet return to the floor one at a time. 

Chamber: the preparatory act within a kick done with the leg before executing the kick, this form of pseudo kick generally results in a knee bent shape pointing towards the intended target. 

Cheat: Takeoff method where the Tricker performs vanish into a wrap for a stance change. Typically from Frontside to Backside during the Takeoff of the Trick although it can be performed from Backside to Frontside. Rotation in Cheat Tricks will include the 180 degree rotation with the rotation measured from Backside. 

Corkscrew:  an off axis gainer full. Performed from Backside - Complete using a BackSwing transition, the performer swings their leg across their body while swinging their arms up to generate a flip and spin. The cork often incorporates some Flatspin in order to avoid a true head over heels inversion.

Combo: linked series of Tricks, completed in succession, these utilize the landing stances, as well as transitions between the Tricks. See Anatomy of a Combo in the Visual Glossary for further clarification.

CoreTrick: a set of movements that meets the criteria to have its own name. Can be the most basic version of a Trick or a more complicated variation of one. Think of this as the move we are trying to isolate when looking at the anatomy of a trick.

Complete (Stance): this is the standard landing position for Backswings, and ultimately contains two sub-stances within it. Backside - Complete. Which is your standard complete that is meant when Complete is said. There is also Outside - Complete. Which is where Lotus is swung from. Complete is often implied by simply stating the number of full twists performed. i.e. single, double, triple etc. 

Cutter:  a nod to the boxcutter, this suffix is generally used on inverted axis tricks in places of the specification Hyper-Hook and can be considered slang.

Crescent Kick - a kick performed in a large wheel motion across the target in its direction of travel. See Inside Crescent Kick, and Outside Crescent Kick.

Crowd Awakener (CA): sidesplit, or straddled variation in which two inverted round kicks are performed. In practice however most circumstances where a wide straddle is achieved will still bare the name, regardless of actual kicks performed.
 
Dark-side:  the opposite side, or doing a trick with the opposite direction of spin from default. It is somewhat uncommon for trickers to utilize both sides, or directions of spin and when they do it is often designated by this tag Dark-side. i.e. Dark-side Gainer, Dark-side Cork. Etc. 

Double Leg: both a unique Trick as well as a variation. The Trick is modeled after the armada dupla from Capoeira. Taking off from two feet jumping into a pike position while rotating  Often described as a gymnastics “pike” position on the last half of a twisting move.

Double (kicking): This variation is most often associated with any kick followed by 360 degrees of rotation (Hyper + Half Gyro) and another of the same kick. Another more rare variation has two fo the same kick on a target with no rotation performed between them. Technically anytime two kicks are delivered in aire it can be called a double, but there is usually a more appropriate suffic to use. In mainstream terminology, the name of the trick begins with the highest rotation and ends with the double suffix. For example: Pop-720-Double. 

Double(twisting): any inverted trick with two rotations around the vertical axis (relative to the tricker’s local space) typically ending in the complete landing stance.

Double (flipping): a flip in which there are two inversions performed where the head feet rotate around the center of the person flipping. Example: double-backflip, double-frontflip, double-sideflip

Dub: a slang term for inverted double twists of any kind when said stand alone it infers a double full, although it will often be used along with other notifiers such as DubCork, DubBack, DubB (double ButterflyTwist)

Eagle: slang term for the starting position for a backswing. Charachterized by the swing leg and arms positioned behind the body preparing for the execution of a backswing trick. 

End(anatomy of a trick): After the majority of criteria of the Trick has been met but there is still some inversion, or rotation needed to complete the movement in air.

Entrance(anatomy of a trick): the entrance is the start of the Trick before any determining movement has been performed, this is where you will find the Takeoff Stance and Takeoff Style. 

Envergado: a fully inverted parafuso. Another way to look at this trick is as an inverted raiz into a double leg. The “enver” prefix can be used to note an envergado fulled by a variation suffix, such as enver-snapu, an envergado followed by a fulltwist in the exit of the trick. 

Exit(anatomy of a trick): after all criteria for the Trick has been met and the only thing left is completing the Landing Stance and Style for the next Transition 

Flip: referring to the inversion of a trick, usually to describe some aspect of the somersault being performed.

Flipping: referring to the elements of tricking that contain inversions, typically starting and ending on the feet. 

FrontFlip: a somersault performed in the air in the forward direction

Fei Long: an in-air kicking combination in which an outside kick is followed by 180 degrees of rotation and an inside kick to the same target. Typically performed with crescent kicks as they allow the hips to stay open and more easily execute both kicks. This is both a specific vert kick as well as a variation type used by both the vertical and inverted axis.

Fei Long Cross: a variation of the Fei Long in which a hook and round are used. 

Feint: faked kick, essentially the kick stops being performed in chamber and is never extended.

Flamingo: similar to the Eagle but in reverse. The flamingo is the starting position for a frontswing and is charachterized by the swinging leg extended in front of the body and the arms raised up, preparing for the execution of a frontswing Trick

Gainer: a backflip performed from one leg, typically swung into. This term is often used to refer casually to both the gainer-flash kick, as well as the gainer switch, using context from the combo to infer which is meant. The gainer prefix can also be used to note a swing takeoff into an inverted trick. i.e. gainer-arabian, gainer-full etc… unlike many other acrobatics, the tricking gainer does not require forward motion.

Grab: similar to many board/wheel sports, it is simply the act of grabbing a part of the body, typically the leg or foot/feet with the hand. This type of variation is still relatively unexplored. 

GrandMaster (GM): a swing takeoff where the performers outside leg swings inwards and initiates an inside flip where the hands do not touch the ground. For example, a masterswipe without landing on the hands becomes a grandmasterswipe. Often used as its abbreivation for prefixing. i.e. GMS for grandmaster swipe, GMT for grandmaster twist, GMSnapu for grandmaster snapu

Gyro: denotes an additional spin performed in the exit of a Trick, most often after a kick or kicking variation. Gyro typically refefers to the vertical axis, and implies that the extra rotation occurs with the performer upright. 

Hawkeye: a variation of a round kick, can be thought of as a round kick where the execution of the kick on target is replaced with that of a hook kick. A round kick start, hook kick middle, round kick finish. A hawkeye can be performed as a variation anywhere you would typically execute a round kick.

Hook Kick: traditional martial arts hook kick. There are many ways to perform this kick when it comes to specific form. Typically it is a kick which executed at or above waist height where the heel of the foot leads across the Target in its Direction of Movement. The kick is Chambered, extended outwards across the Target, which has been spotted and then re-chambered during which the planted foot may pivot to maintain balance. 

Hyper (deprecated): In the past (before the landing stances had been established) Hyper was used to note the over-rotation of a trick, and landing on the opposite foot. While this understanding is still used it is widely understood that a more specific meaning is meant. Typically referring to a landing stance, or a kicking variation. 

Hyper (stance): a landing position on the invert axis where the performer rotates past the complete position, and lands on their inside kicking leg, with the performers momentum is pulling backwards or toward their inside flipping shoulder, this position typically allows the performer to wrapthrough, or swingthrough into GMswings. 

Hyper (vert kicking): in the context of vert kicking, hyper simply means to landing on the kicking leg. In the TKT system, this term is specifically a 180 degree rotation after a kick, landing on both feet simultaneously. Largely replaced with the term Turbo to refer to the two-footed laning. This term can also be, and often is, used as a blanket term that covers Hyper(vert kicking), Hyper-Style, True-Hyper.

Hyper-Hook(trick): refers specifically to a B-Twist Hyper Hook. Where the butterfly twist is over rotated to the hyper landing stance and an outside kick (hook) is performed. 

Hyper-Hook (variation): a variation used on the invert axis, this suffix signifies that the trick was landed in the hyper stance while performing an outside kick (hook) during the exit of the kick. 

Hyper-Style (vert kicking): a landing variation in which 180 degrees of rotation is performed after a vertical, but the original landing leg (non-kicking) is still used. This term is primarily used within TKT, and rarely used in mainstream terminology.

Inside Crescent Kick: Similar to the round kick, but generally done with a straight leg. The key difference is that the foot stays in a vertical position throughtout this kick, and strikes with the inside edge of the foot. 

Inside Flip: the inside flip is a sideflip toward the direction of the performers twists and is performed from any of the inside stances such as Hyper, Mega or Inside. The inside flip is considered the base flip for the Tak axis, as well as GMswing tricks. 

Inside Kick: generic term referring to either a round, or an inside crescent kick. Performed by whichever leg will execute a strike while traveling to the inside of the person performing it. 

Inside (Stance) stance between frontside and backside where the performers hips are squarely facing the “Target”. Also often referred to as “neutral stance”. Many people begin their backside tricks from this position. 

Invert: The act of flipping within a trick. In order to be a true inverted trick, the hips must reach a point higher than the performers head during the trick. However, in general tricks reaching approximately horizontal orientation (180 degrees), or where the hips are level with the performers head are considered to be Inverted tricks. 

JackKnife: an in air kicking combination in which an inside kick is followed by 180 degrees of rotation and an outside kick to the same target. This is typically performed with a round kick followed by a hook kick on the same target. The use of round kick encourages the hips to turn over allowing the hook to come out more naturally as opposed to the body positioning when using inside and outside crescents. 

J Step: a common setup used for swing tricks. The performer steps forward with a variable amount of steps, typically two, but could be many.  The final step is always performed with the outside leg, often referred to as the plant leg, the foot is turned 90 degrees outward and the trailing leg is swung through. The turn creates a J pattern on the ground and allows for blocking to generate lift in the swing trick being executed. This patter also allows the hips to be square increasing the ease of movement and power able to be generated from the swing. 

Kata: Japanese word meaning “form”. These forms typically refer to a series of choreographed Martial Arts movements designed to be practiced alone or in sync with others. They are used as a way to demonstrate, as well as cultivate, the practitioners mastery of skills. Kata refers to a specific “way of doing” with emphasis on the form and order of the process. In other words a deeply focused, embodied practice. 

Knife (variation): this suffix is added to both invert tricks as well as vert kicks. In vert kicking it implies either a hypered inside kick or swipe was performed at some point during the trick followed by a hook kick while landing. In invert trick it implies that a trick will be landing in hyper landing stance while performing an outside kick (hook) 

Kyro (variation): any hyper-hook variated trick followed by an additional twist or gyro. For example a cork kyro is a boxcutter followed by an additional 360 degree rotation after the hyper hook has been performed. This typically means a majority of this last rotation is performed during the exit of the trick in a semi upright position. 

K-Step: a term generally used to describe a variation of the cheat takeoff where a double pivot is used. The K-step chooses to move forward into the trick generating a lot of blocking for lift. This form of cheat takeoff is very popular among the Korean Trickers and as such was named the K-Step, short for Korean Step.

Landing Stance: The position in which a trick terminates. For both vertical kicks and invert tricks there are a multitude of possible positions, each carrying their own transitional possibilities. There are BIFO:  Backside, Inside, Frontside, Outside and CHMS: Complete, Hyper, Mega, and Semi. These BIFO and CHMS landing stances overlap with each other and create all of the possible landing stances. Backside Inside Outside and Frontside refer mainly to how square your hips are to the target and which direction. Complete Hyper Mega and Semi give context to which direction is being traveled and specifies how the feet are landing. Complete(backwards) and Mega(forwards) referring to the outside leg touching the ground. Hyper (backwards) and Semi (forwards) referring to the inside leg touching the ground. See graphics for further disambiguation 

Late-: sometimes followed by a number such as late-9 or late 10 implying a kick type( round or hook) referring to the bs900 (round) or bs1080 (hook) in mainstream terminology. Although many people have begun using late-round and late-hook to make the differentiation. A late kick is characterized by the trick being primarily completed but an over-rotation performed while executing a kick. This is different from the hyper-hook variation in that the kick is executed after the foot has landed as opposed to beginning in the air. 

Mainstream (Terminology): the most common language and set of terms used by trickers. Many of the names date back to the originis of tricking and sport karate circuits of the 1990s. Mainstream terminology is more or less an oral tradition. Many definitions and concepts can be deduced from common usage within the community at large and older Tricking websites but there is no central location or formal standardization. It is a loose system with varying perspectives and opinions that change from community to community as well as individual to individual. However when viewed as a whole mainstream terminology can thought of as the common dialect that almost all trickers can communicate with. 

MasterSwipe: a GMswing trick where the performers hands touch the ground. The difference between the master and the grandmaster is whether or not the performers hands touch during the trick. In a master trick the performer will touch with both hands in the middle of the trick while the grandmaster tricks will be performed completely in the air. 

Master: a term reffering to two hands touching the ground during the middle of a trick. This is inbetween a sequential hand placement of a cart and the unified hand placement of a spring.

Mega (stance): landing position on the invert axis where the performer rotates past the hyper position and lands on the outside kicking leg, with their momentum pulling them forward or toward their inside flipping shoulder. This stance is 180 degrees past the complete landing stance and can often be looked at as a half rotation added to the core-trick. Mega landings allow the performer to perform front swings such as aerial and btwist axis tricks.

Mega-Round: Similar to a hyper-hook. A mega-round is a suffix used to describe landing in the mega landing stance while performing a round kick. Commonly referred to as late-round See Late-

Missleg: singular transition in which the in-air leg rebounds into the next trick. It could be said that the leg literally misses the ground and changes its path to create a new takeoff. Often used where a sequential takeoff is typically utilized where the leading leg is intentionally misses the ground and moves into a boneless swing. See Boneless; Swing(takeoff)

Middle (anatomy of a trick): the main part of the Trick where most of the movement is performed, this is where the most common variations will typically take place, although any part of the anatomy of the trick may contain a variation. 

Momentum Line: the imaginary line created  by a tricker as they travel throughout a combo. The momentum line is generally perpendicular to the target both in theory as well as practice. See DOM

Murder (grab): a variation of a swing through transition in which the swinging leg was grabbed in the previous trick, and held throughout the transition. For example when doing a cork-rodeo, landing while maintaining the rodeo-grab and swinging the grabbed foot into another cork, the second cork would receive the name Murder-Cork.

Muggle: a somewhat controversial term within the community. Many tend to think that it implies a derogatory meaning towards those people who do not Trick. While it has been used by some in that way the original meaning was an homage to the world of Harry Potter in which the muggles were those individuals who did not know about the Magic world that they existed along side. Early usage of the term often referred to those people who had not been opened up to the magic of Tricking and expanded to imply someone who had not been opened up to the magic of LIFE. The magic in this case being amazing potentials and exciting possibilities that are beyond the view of the everyday person stuck in the rat race. 

NASKA: The North American Sports Karate Association. Naska is one of the oldest, and most prestigious sport karate leagues. It served as the birth place for many of the tricks commonly found within Tricking today, as well as bringing together many of the early practitioners that led its growth over the years.

Neutral (stance): typically used when discussing vert kicking setups. Neutral refers to either Inside when talking about Backside Kicks or Outside when talking about Frontside Tricks. Neutral is a contextual term that switches its meaning and can be confusing to some. 

OC: an original combo. A slang term used to note a combo that has a particular high degree of originality, creativity, and/or technicality. OC began to be thrown around in response to the CookieCutter Combos that were often performed by many trickers. People became tired of seeing Ch9-&gt;Hook-&gt;TDR-&gt;Cork-&gt; (swing chain) and would encourage people to do more OC’s meaning, do something we haven’t already seen a million times.

Outside Crescent Kick: similar to a hook kick, but generally done with a straight leg. The main difference is that the foot stays in a vertical position, with the toes facing up, throughout this kick. It strikes across the target with the outside edge of the foot.

Outside Flip: the outside flip is a sideflip in the opposite direction of the performers twists and is performed from any of the outside stances such as Complete, Semi, or Outside. The outside flip is considered the base flip for the raiz and lotus axis tricks.

Outside Kick: generic term referring to either a hook, or outside crescent kick. Performed by whichever leg will execute a strike while traveling to the outside of the person performing it.

Outside Stance: stance between backside and frontside where the performers hips face away from the target. It is very common to see trickers adopt this as the starting point for frontside tricks and is commonly referred to as “neutral”.

Parafuso: similar to a double leg. The parafuso can be described as a cheat takeoff into a double leg where the legs come together on the target. Typically the performer executes an outside crescent kick to the target, while holding the outside kick on target they perform an inside crescent kick to match it on target, the kicks then continue in a double leg fashion for completion. It is important to note the back stays primarily upright in this trick and the hips remain below the head at all times. This is the main differentiation from the double leg. It is not uncommon to see “para” used as a prefix to describe any double leg variation on both the vertical and invert axes which is generally understood and accepted interchangeably.

Peter Pan: a shape variation, or body position taken during a trick in which the performer places both fists on their hips, with their elbows out wide, similar to the stance taken by Peter Pan in the animated Disney movie.

Pizzaboy: a variation similar to a scissor or helicoptero. Pizzaboys have been described as a flashkick swing tornado kick in the air before landing. The pizzaboy completes the flashkick or swipe before transitioning to the tornado, and can be added to any move with a swipe or flashkick motion. Another way to descibe it is by saying that it is a swipe or flash followed by a late-round (mega-round).

Pop: a transition where a sequential landing is followed by a unified take off. Or more simply put it lands one foot then the second and takes off with both feet simultaneously into the next trick. This method of takeoff where the performer steps or hops into a jump with both feet simultaneously is commonly used in both invert tricks as well as vert kicks.

Pump: term used to describe the lifting of the knee, as if chambering, durring the rotation of vert kicks. This usually means the non-kicking leg will be pumped prior to extending the kick with the opposite leg, and can be used to generate height, rotation, and hip positioning for the kick. 

Punch: a transition where a unified landing immediately rebounds into a unified takeoff. For most trickers this looks like a powerful stomp into the ground using the floors rebound to generate power and height in the next trick

Pure Setups: a pure setup is the initial movements used to generate momentum and put the body in position to begin the first Trick of a combo. These include J-Step, K-Step, Euro-Step, Pivot, Spin Step, Skip Step, as well as Standing.

Rapid: a transition similar to the misleg, can be described as a one-legged punch. 

Rechamber: the act of returning the kicking leg back to the Chambered position after the kick has been performed. This allows for greater control during landing as it brings the performers center of gravity back under them.

Recycle: slang term for a master swing performed typically from a hook kick into a vert kick. This allows swings into backside without additional rotation or pivot needed. 

(Skip Reversal)Redirect: another form a reversal transition. Redirect transitions lands sequentially, followed by an adjustment step, and takes off in the reverse sequence from its landings. L-R-Adjustment-R-L

Reversal: sequential transition where the sequence of landing and takeoff are reversed. Lands L-R Takes off R-L or vice versa. 

Reverse: older term used to describe traveling backwrd into a trick, or a trick that doesnt usually have backward travel performed with it. 

Reverse Pop: a transition that that lands unified and takes off sequentially. This is the inverse of a Pop transition. It lands with two feet together and takes off one then the other. 

Rocket Boy: a variation where the performer reaches down while in a piked, or double leg, position and grabs the opposite ankle with their hand while the other arm reaches high above the head during an inverted trick. 

Rodeo: a variation whre the performer reaches back and grabs their ankle. This is generally accompanied by pushing forward with the hips and arching the back to further emphasize the position. Grab can be performed with one arm or both simultaneously.

Round Kick: traditional martial arts roundhouse kick. There are many ways to perform this trick but the general guideline is that the foot is turned horizontally upon striking its target and is typically performed with the inside kicking leg. The contact point traditionally is the ball of the foot, or when toes are pointed can anywhere from the top of the foot to the base of the shin. More simply put a kick performed at or above waist height in which the toes of the foot leads across the target in its direction of travel.

-Round: a variation where a complete rotation is completed on the invert axis followed by a round kick. For example a cork ending with a round kick in complete landing stance would be called a Cork-Round.

Safari: a variation similar to the Rocket Boy but utilizing a shuriken, instead of the pike, or double leg position. The arm opposite of the kicking leg will make the grab to create the proper position. Put another way a safari is a type of cross body grab when performing a shuriken in an invert trick. 

Scissor: a variation where the performer performs a twist kick in the place of a traditional -round variation. So a cork-round performed with a twist kick becomes a cork-scissor. In order to get the hip position for the kick to come out many cork-scissors land in mega. Can also be used as slang term for a scissor-swipe. 

Scissor-swipe: a variation on the martial arts scissor kick in which an outside kick or side kick is performed simultaneously with an inverted roudn kick, or twist kick with the other leg. This variation is most often applied to invert tricks. Within the tricking community the only emphasis is on the twist kick, or inverted round. Many people have opted to drop the swipe as it does not have a tricking “swipe” in it and refer to this simply as scissor. 

Setup: a movement used to generate momentum and get into the starting position for a particular Trick. This generally refers to pure setups however it can sometimes be used to include Setup Tricks or even Setup Combos. See Pure Setups; Setup Tricks; Setup Combos; for further detail. 

Setup Tricks: a trick performed to generate momentum to be used in a larger trick or combo. This is typically things like Cartwheel, Roundoff, Aerial, Gumbi, Raiz, Touchdown Raiz, Backhandspring, Macaco, Scoot, Masterscoot, or even a Hook kick. However any trick that generates momentum can be used. Even more difficult ones such as Btwist, Cork, or DoubleCork. Can also be used to refer to what tricks you can do before a particular movement, such as cork, double cork, btwist etc. 

Setup Combos: a series of Tricks performed to generate momentum to be used in a larger Trick or combo. People will often refer to their Dub-Dub Setups meaning what tricks they have combo’d into Dub-Dub. Or put another way what combos they are able to perform Dub-Dub out of. 

Semi (stance): landing position on the invert axis where the performer rotates past the mega postion and lands on the inside kicking leg, with their momentum pulling forward or toward their outside flipping shoulder. This stance is 180 degrees past hyper position and can be looked at as a half rotation added to the core trick. Semi landings allow the performer to swingthrough into frontswings, raiz, and spyder axis tricks.

Sequential: this term describes a landing or takeoff style where the feet land one at a time. When used to describe transitions it typically means that both the landing and takeoff styles occur sequentially. 

Shuriken(variation): a variation type on the invert axis whre an outside kick is performed while twisting, followed by landing on the kicking leg in the complete stance. In higher rotations further twisting can be performed after the kick and still be labled shuriken.

Single (twisting): any inverted trick with the performer executing a full rotation around their vertical axis into the complete landing stance.

Singular: this term describes a landing or takeoff style where only one foot lands during the transition. 

Skip: another form of a vanish transition. Skip lands sequentially, followed by an adjustment step, and takes off in the same sequence as its landing. L-R-Adjustment-L-R

Snapu(trick): short for snapuswipe. This trick is essentially an inverted 540 Gyro. Or another way to picture it is a sideswipe full twist. The performer executes a vanish into a swipe and then rotates an additional 360 degrees to land on their feet.

Snapu(variation): a variation where any swipe is followed by a full twist. For example a cork swipe fulltwist is a cork snapu

Somersault: an acrobatic movement in which a person turns head over heels in the air or on the ground and lands or finishes on their feet 

Spring: a term referring to two hands touching the ground during the middle of a trick in a unified fashion. These are typically performed similar to a back or front handspring motion but can be applied to all invert tricks. 

Squirrel: very similar to a rodeo Grab, the main difference is the performer reaches for and maybe touches, but never actually grabs their foot/ankle. See Rodeo

Stepover (takeoff): similar to a swing the inside kicking leg is lifted while pivoting up to 180 degrees in the direction of typical rotation however in the stepover the swing takes the chambered position and the performer then “steps over” their chamber while still in the air.  

Swing (takeoff:kicks): method of takeoff where the performer lifts their inside kicking leg while pivoting up to 180 degrees in the direction of their typical rotation. 

Swing (takeoff:inverts): method of takeoff where the performer uses their inside kicking leg to generate power and inversion to begin an invert trick. See Backswing and Frontswing

Swing (transition): singular transition in which the in-air leg travels in a parabolic arc underneath the performer uninterrupted and is used to generate power and lift for the next trick. 

Swipe: an inside kick that lands on the kicking leg where the hips reach mostly horizontal or more inversion. Trickers typically target high in the air above them for this trick in order to generate inversion.

Swipe-Knife(trick): a swipe hyper-hook. Similar to a jackknife it replaces the inside round kick with a swipe. The performer will vanish into a swipe performing a hook while landing on the initial kicking leg.

Swipe-Knife(variation): a compound variation. The Swipe-Knife suffix is reserved for inverted tricks as the swipe implies some level of inversion. It is very similar to a jackknife, although it uses a swipe in place of the inside kick. 

Tak: short for Takuraba, a wrap takeoff into a frontflip.

TakFull: one of the most common variations of the takuraba, a takfull takes off from the hyper stance and wraps into an inverted full twist back to a complete stance.
	Tak9: TakFull-Round, a variation of the TakFull where an inside kick, typically a round is performed during the landing.

TKT (True Kick Terminology): a systematized approach to the study of tricking, founded by Dan Perez DeTejada. This system is widely known for naming kicks by their true rotational value. TKT is often congruent with the Aeriform Martial Arts Tricking system which is known for its systemized breakdown of many parts of tricking, from takeoffs to landings, to transitional definitions and beyond.

Tornado (kick): one of the most basic kicks, and often one of the first tricks people learn. A tornado kick is a cheat takeoff followed by 180 degrees of in-air rotation and an inside kick (typically a round) is performed on target. In TKT this is written as cheat360round, the extra 180 degrees coming from the on-ground rotation in the cheat setup.

Transition: movement performed in between Tricks that allows them to be linked, can be used to reposition for the next intended Trick, or generate power. Transitions are broken into several categories based on the general sequence of landing one trick and taking off into the next. Its categories include Singular, Unified, and Sequential.

Triple (kicking): this is most often associated with three consecutive, alternating kicks to the target while spinning. Technically speaking anytime three kicks are performed in-air it can be considered a triple, however there is typically a more accurate term to use in these cases. See Hurricane.

Triple (twisting): any inverted trick with three twists around the performers vertical axis landing in a complete stance. 

True-Hyper (vert kicking): a landing in which 180 degrees of rotation is performed after a vertical kick that lands on the kicking leg. This term is used almost exclusively within the TKT community, and is implied by the generic term Hyper among most mainstream terminology users.

Turbo (vert kicking): a two footed landing variation. This term has taken over the mainstream terminology to replace Hyper (TKT) when refering to kicks that have a variated landing. 

Trick: a set of movements, typically acrobatic in nature, performed that can be referred to by a name that differentiates itself from other movements.

Twisting: the elements of tricking related to the rotational aspect of the acrobatic movements being performed

Twist: referring to the rotation around the vertical axis local to the performer. Think of this as rotating around an imaginary line through the center of your body. Another way to describe it is as a spin around the body’s center during an inverted trick.

Unified: this term describes any landing or takeoff styles that utilize both feet simultaneously. When used to describe a transitions it typically means that the takeoff is unified.

Vanish: sequential transition in which the landing and takeoff folllow the same sequence. Landing L-R Taking off L-R. Or vice versa.

Variation: performing any trick in a way that deviates form its base skill. This often means the addition of a kick, grab, rotation, or body shape, or could mean an adjustment to the Transition, Flip, DOM, or setup.

Vert Kick(kicking): kick delivered with no major degree of inversion. The performer stays relatively upright throughout the execution of the trick.

WackKnife(trick): variation on the jackknife where the rotation between the first and second kicks has been removed. Upon executing an inside kick on target the performer re-chambers the inside leg while simultaneously chambering and executing an outside kick to the same target. This is almost always accomplished utilizing inside and outside crescent kicks which allow the hips to stay open and fixed toward the target while the legs are in motion. 

WackKnife (variation): a variation that can be used with vert or invert tricks. see WackKnife(trick)

Windex: slang term for a raiz hyper-hook. Commonly understood as a swipeknife without the swipe. 

Wrap: a type of transition that generally refers to an onground adjustment pivot from one stance into another during takeoff. This could be from Hyper&gt;Semi; Semi&gt;Hyper; Complete&gt;Mega; Mega&gt;Complete

Wrap(kicks): when used in vert kicking the wrap generally refers to a trick whose cheat is over-rotated past what is generally accepted for cheat takeoffs.

Wrap(invert): when used in invert tricks the wrap generally refers to as a hyper landing stance where the performer pivots into either a frontside hyper, or a semi takeoff stance for a front swing into the trick. Most common is wrap-full, all Tak based tricks utilize this in their takeoff. 

X-Out(variation:shape): variation in which the body is positioned with both legs kicked out into a straddle position in-air. This variation sometimes uses the arms as well to create a true X shape with the body although the straddled legs generally meet the criteria when referring to invert tricks.  </Text>

            <Text>	With that understanding lets now take a look at Tricking “moves” and the general “move-set” that have been laid out up to now. We will start broadly and then hone into some of the details to get a picture of this system and how it interacts with itself. Don’t forget to explore the Terms Glossary at the end of this section to get a better understanding of some of these Tricks as we will be moving through these rather quickly. I’ve tried to include some graphics that will help you to visualize the connections these various Tricks have. The goal here is not for you to necesarily understand all of tricking terminology but to develop a basic idea of how things are connected together. We will be going into specifics for each area of terminology in later sections. 
In our simple description of Tricking we have said that it is a combination of Kicks, Flips and Twists. We will now break these down a bit further, what do we mean by each of these things? Kicks, often taken from the Martial Arts roots Tricking came out of, refer generally to those actions performed with the legs during a movement. Flips, often taken from Gymnastic Tumbling, and sometimes Breakdancing, refer generally to those actions performed which cause the body to be inverted to some degree. Twists, often taken from all disciplines, generally refers to the rotational quality of an action performed such as a flip or kick. Each move can have one, some, or all of these qualities to them. So in a way our simple description gives a rudimentary sketch of the ways in which each move within Tricking can be made up.
Lets learn some of the jargon we commonly use to talk about Tricking. A  A &quot;Trick&quot; is the name we give to a particular set of movements that meet a criteria. For instance the hook kick we learned in one of the previous sections. When someone is Tricking, however, they generally do not perform simply one move, they often perform a combination of movements linked together successively. We refer to these movement chains as a “combo” or sometimes as a “pass”. Each of these individual “Tricks” (I will often refer to them as “moves”) are linked together with other “moves” more specifically called “transitions”. “Transitions” are a particular type of movement that can bridge between the end state of one “Trick” to the beginning state of another “Trick”.
Tricks are often built up out of other tricks with one being a base/core move that give the main structure with other movements added to it. Combining two or more distinct movements into one new movement is called variating and is how new Tricks are most often created. Utilizing the types of tricks we will cover next will allow us to start building an understanding of the entire Tricking framework that now exists and how to interact with it.

            <Title>Ask a Tricker</Title>
            <Text>If you’ve ever asked someone who participates in this thing the question “What is Tricking?” You were most likely met first with a long sigh and then some version of this bottled answer. Tricking is a combination of kicks, flips, and twists; or, Tricking is a combination of elements from various forms of Martial Arts, Gymnastics Tumbling and Breakdancing. While these do point to the visible action taking place within Tricking as it occurs, it does so only as a reference to the parts that it came from. It’s quite understandable that this is what happens because in general, there is no good frame of reference to explain it in any other way. Unfortunately this completely misses the reality of what it is. 
So why does this happen? When someone has not experienced something for themselves and we want to share our experience with them we have to point to things in our description that the other person HAS experienced first hand. We do this because that person can conjure up an idea of what those constituent parts are and try to bring them together. So in the explanation that Tricking is a combination of kicks, flips, and twists. Someone who has no frame of reference for the idea of “Tricking” can then create a visual concept of someone moving through the air in unique ways. Performing some feats of acrobatics by hurling their bodies through the air in some series of jumps and somersaults with some kicks flailing about.  
This picture that is painted is always a mis-appropriation of what Tricking really is but for the sake of our argument we should continue down this road to understand why people default to this answer. Thinking of the “moves” that make up the “move-set” within the performance of Tricking, as what Tricking is, makes sense because in some way it “IS” this, but only in some way. I hope to make it clear how this partial picture makes it difficult to communicate the deeper understanding of what Tricking is and why it is important.</Text>

            <Title>Play</Title>
            <Text>We’ve all had this experience in some form or another. A kid walks up to you and eagerly asks you to “watch me do a trick!” after which they proceed to take a few awkward steps and jump up and flail their body a bit. You watch as their face lights up with excitement, “did you see!?!” they exclaim! You give a gentle nod and smile breaks across your face, the joy they feel for some silly reason is contagious. I mean arguably the kid didn’t actually do anything impressive by average standards. But for some reason we are excited for them. I think this is because all of us remember at some point the way that they were feeling. Filled with a sense of pride in their discovery. They just learned something new that they can make their bodies do. That exploration of “what can my body do” is something we are constantly exploring as children. 
As we get older it’s easy for us to lose that excitement over the little discoveries we make about our capabilities. Each day begins to feel the same as the last and we forget what it means to just jump around and play. Society justifies us in our actions by pushing the idea that play is for children, and adults need to be productive. That’s putting the cart before the horse a bit if you ask me. It creates the kind of productivity that is mindless, careless, and minimum effort. Just striving to meet the bare minimum criteria to be done with the task. This kind of productivity produces just for the sake of production. The great inventions that push our society forward rarely come out of this kind of work, yet this is what the majority of people spend time optimizing. 
The proper response to this is to put the horse back where it goes, leading the cart. In other words play needs to be preceding and fostering our productivity, not just acting as a reward for it. Play is a word that, in western culture especially, often infers a sense of aimlessness to the task, a lack of utility. This is a shallow view to take and ignores the immense value that play has to add to our lives. Play is important for us not just as a means of entertainment or “fun”, but as a tool for cultivating and enacting the skills often associated with imagination, exploration, collaboration, and creation. So even the utilitarians out there shouldn’t write this off just yet.
We have a number of ways we can play, we can play alone(imagination), we can play with an object(exploration), we can play with others(collaboration), and we can also play with ideas and systems of ideas(creation). Each of these contribute to an environment that is primed for a progressive learning to take place. 
Play while alone typically involves utilizing the imagination skills we have in order to generate some interesting narrative to entertain us in some way. 
Play with an object enables us to explore the object and it’s potentials, allowing for the discovery of those potentials and more we have yet to uncover. 
Play with others creates an environment where we are forced to collaborate in order to engage in the same activity without running into issues.
Play with an idea and the system within which it the idea is embedded allows for the creation of new ideas out of this.

            <Title>Stances</Title>
            <Text>STANCES:
	Starting with the stances. These can be a bit confusing at first as there are many options that overlap with each other but if we take it one step at a time we can see how we build up to the Advanced Stances below on the right. Many people have been utilizing a dated version of the stances as seen below on the left. This has been &quot;good enough&quot; for the past few years but it is time for the charts to catch up to the level of complexity that is being performed by Trickers these days. 

*Insert Graphic Old Landing Stances(left) &amp;&amp; Advanced Stances Grid(Right)*

	The Stances can be either Landing Stances or Takeoff Stances. The same terminology is used for both as many times one landing stance is the next Tricks takeoff stance. For both vertical kicks and invert tricks there are a multitude of possible positions, each carrying their own transitional possibilities. We can break the options down into the BIFO and CHMS grids. BIFO stands for Backside, Inside, Frontside, and Outside. These refer primarily to how square your hips are to the target and in which direction. These are also used as a way to categorize the many invert tricks based on the &quot;general orientation&quot; of the Trick to the target during execution.
	CHMS stands for Complete, Hyper, Mega, and Semi. These give context to the direction being traveled and specifies which foot is being placed down. Complete(backwards) and Mega(forwards) referring to the outside leg (left for left twisters) touching the ground. Hyper(backwards) and Semi(forwards) referring to the inside leg(right for left twisters) touching the ground. As we can see in the graphics below the direction of momentum is consistent throughout each stance. This is because it is what we are using to determine which stance we are in. Backside Complete being the default starting position. 
	As we can see on the separated grids below each of the 8 Stances we have mentioned (BIFO and CHMS) each cover roughly 180 degrees of the available 360 degrees worth of orientations possible. This is far more than shown in the stances laid out in the Advanced Stances Grid at the beginning of this section. This is because the Advanced Stances Grid shows us the most common combinations of these landing stances due to the orientation of foot and hips in these positions. It's also makes for an easy way to fit it all into one graphic for quick reference. However when we look at the separated grids below we can actually get a fuller picture of the true possibilities.  
***Insert Separated BIFO and Separated CHMS Grid***
	Hopefully these graphics are making it a bit easier to frame how these various stances describe the orientation to your DOM. Backside is when our Back is to our DOM. Frontside is when our Front is to our DOM. Inside is when we are facing towards the imaginary target. Outside is when we are facing away from the imaginary target. Complete and Mega refer to our left foot (for left twisters) and Hyper and Semi refer to our right foot (for left twisters). Complete and Hyper mean we are going backwards in relation to our DOM, Mega and Semi mean we are going forwards. So when we layer these pieces all together we should come out with something like the two graphics below. This &quot;essentially&quot; shows all of the landing combinations for each leg. You'll notice some of the landings are grayed out this is to indicate the stances that are least played with, primarily due to the anatomy of knees and ankles. Regardless these stances do technically exist so we should mention them. 
***Insert Advanced CHMS GRID Right and Left***
	As you can see in the graphic above the stances for the Left Leg include Backside Complete (this is the most standard landing) as well as Outside Complete and Inside Complete when traveling backwards and Frontside Mega (the most common mega) as well as Inside Mega and Outside Mega. The Right leg has the same options just applied to Hyper and Semi respectively. So that gives us Backside Hyper (the most common) as well as Inside Hyper and Outside Hyper when traveling backwards and Frontside Semi (the most common) as well as Inside Semi and Outside Semi. All of these give us the following List:

Backside Complete
Backside Hyper
Inside Complete
Inside Hyper
Inside Mega
Inside Semi
Frontside Mega
Frontside Semi
Outside Complete
Outside Hyper
Outside Mega
Outside Semi	
	You'll notice that Backside and Frontside stances only have stances that go in the same direction as they do. Hyper and Complete for Backside and Mega an Semi in Frontside. Technically you could land in Backside Semi Or Mega but it would mean that you are changing you DOM in the landing/takeoff stance. And since your DOM is the point of reference this technically would shift you from being in &quot;Backside&quot; Semi to Backside Hyper due to your DOM going behind you now. Typically this is when the prefix Fake is used because the Backside Semi is a FAKE Semi because it is really a Backside Hyper. Fake stances really aren't that difficult to understand if you have a better understanding of the stances like we just laid out.
*** Insert Advanced Stances Grid *** 
	By now we should be starting to get comfortable with these stances and how they are working with each other to describe something to us about the Trick taking place. We are getting information about the orientation of the Trickers body to their direction of momentum and describing which foot is being utilized. If this is a takeoff stance we know they are entering the Trick. If this is a landing stance we know they are exiting the Trick.
	Up till now these stances have been exclusively used in their full by the invert tricks. However, you may have noticed in many of the charts there was a mention of a hook, or a round in each of the stances. This is because knowing which foot we are landing on can easily tell us which leg we have available to perform a certain kick in the air. We will discuss this at more length in the kicking section. 
	These stances are great to give us information about a Trick when the foot is touching the ground but how do we get into and out of these stances. That is where our setups and transitions come in.</Text>

            <Title>Who WE are IS the Offer</Title>
            <Text>Ultimately what we have to offer up to the culture, of Tricking or anything, is who we are. What we bring to things is everything about us in that moment that is different from the others we are sharing the moment with. Allowing ourselves to participate by doing something is 90 percent of the battle. The other 10 percent is knowing when to try to impose our will on the culture and when to shift our ways to fit within it. Some cultures are constantly pushing people to conform to a very particular way of doing something, whether for efficiency or uniformity. However within Ticking the culture is constantly reinforcing those who go against conventions and do something in an altogether different way. 
	It has been said of Tricking that there is really only one rule that matters. “There are rules, break them.”. To elaborate on this. As we painstakingly attempted to layout in the Terminology and Technicals section. The criteria to meet a particular Trick are loose ones with much room for variability. This encourages each Tricker to bring their own uniqueness to Tricks. Instead of forcing people to all do it exactly the same way, diluting the expression and making them mere accomplishments. Tricking allows for a fullness to be brought to the experience. Both for the Tricker and for the spectator. 
As a Human, we have particular facts that are ours and only ours. When we were born, how tall we are, who our family is, where we grew up. These things all help to inform the way we approach things. It’s in the way that we approach things that we can bring our individual experience out into the world. Whether that is the case of writing, art, dancing, building something, or Tricking, it’s all the same. No one will do this thing the way that we will, and we will never do this thing the way that others will. Not exactly at least. We may be able to accomplish many of the same tasks as the other artisans. But it is our involvement that allows for a differentiation. 
	Within Tricking this is the expression of the Tricks someone performs. The way an individual chooses to explore tricking will inform what they have at their disposal when they go to just Trick. There is training tricks and then their is Tricking. Tricking comes after one has trained Tricks. Much like art comes after one has trained in a particular medium. A Tricker is an artist and the body is their brush, or a more accurate analogy a musician whose instrument is their body. Each combo a song. Each trick a note. Transitions being the empty space between the notes. Performed, it is alive as it unfolds and ceases to be as it terminates. Only those who captured it in their experience truly know what it was like. Even watching through video is simply not the same as watching that perfect execution play out before your very eyes. 
The experience of music is like this. Listening to a song recording has a certain value, but it is always somehow lacking when compared with the performance by a true master of their craft. There is a moreness to the experience that is entered into by the spectator and the performer. Something beyond a simple description. Something more akin to an honest experience of the performer being shared with the world. That is what Tricking is. The unfolding of a series of movements that express something about the performer. Something about who they are, and what they value, something about their strengths and weakness, something about them that we don’t typically encounter in our blase conversations from day to day. However here in this moment while watching this Tricking combo unfold they seem to shout it with every muscle fiber in their being. This is who I am, see me here now, and then it fades away. Temporary as we are. 
There is a deep beauty in the transience of these moments. They capture something within them that gets lost the second it stops happening. Something that must be rekindled in the next display, however it will never be the same. It will never be as it was that last time, and recording it only preserves some of the value. 
It’s this beauty in Tricking, that if we allow ourselves to be turned towards, can enrich our lives in ways that we didn’t quite realize before. When we are the practioner we are also our own spectator. Just as the musician, we have the ability to not only enjoy the performance but the experience, although from a different vantage point. The way it feels to do Tricks that we like to do, overcoming difficult challenges we have set for ourselves and exploring this thing authentically first hand. It’s how we take up this project of tricking and make it our own that allows us to bring something new and valuable back into the Culture from which we took.
This realization should be extended into all domains. It is how we come to things and take them up as our own that makes it possible for us to contribute something back to it. If we were to simply follow every convention that was passed down to us to a T there would be complete stagnation, nothing would grow and progress and evolve into something more than it is now. Many things having their dogmas make rigid things that should flow. 
The general attitude of Tricking seems to be to constantly look around to see if there is something it hasn’t incorporated yet and try to bring it in. If you take this attitude that Tricking has towards its culture into other areas, I believe we have the possibility to breathe new life into these areas. That’s not to say we should come into a culture and immediately start imposing our way of doing things upon it. Not at all. 
*** Insert Graphic Amoeba of Tricking Culture***
We can use a metaphor to think about the way in which the Tricking culture does this. Looking at the picture of blobs above we can think of Tricking as if it is an amoeba, an amorphous blob of sorts. When someone is coming into tricking for the first time. They have to figure out everything about the amoeba as it is right now.(as we did in the preceding chapters) As they get more and more information about it they will start doing things and showing them to the amoeba to see if it has that covered or not. It will then either incorporate these cells(new concept or idea) into its structure or dispel with them. This decision being formed by the community at large responding to the new appearance of something that either has or hasn’t been seen before. Either way the response is what drives the decision. 
*** Insert Growth of Domain Graphic**
It isn’t only our explicit contributions to a domain that have an impact. It’s the implicit implications they typically carry with them. In the graphic above shows us how a domain typically grows. In effect, there is a circle which covers the specialized knowledge contained within the domain. This knowledge has it’s own terms, and ways of approaching problems as well as methods and practice it has determined are superior. Before we can truly begin to make any notable contributions it is required that we familiarize ourselves with the landscape the domain has already laid out for us. Only once we have exhausted this exploration and begin to poke at an edge that has yet to be uncovered can we begin to make a dent. This little bubble that start to form as we explore this previously unexplored area allows for not just the immediate discoveries to be made but also for the realization of other areas that could be explored in a similarly new way. This effective expansion of the domains knowledge base is what pushes the domain forward. Sometimes these small bubbles that form eventually grow into their own sub-domains eventually becoming full blown Fields of study themselves. 
It is only through the continued contribution of its members that this happens though. And those who respect the culture they are coming into the most will, while often gentle to explore those areas, when they find something they will be strongly vocal about its importance. It isn’t just the accomplishment that gets added to the culture. Its the way in which the accomplishment came about. That mode of exploring the domain. It is this which revitalizes the culture and allows it to continue to push its domain further. By changing the ways that it is interacted with to uncover new and different features that were lying dormant when viewed from that other mode. This thing that was thought to have been explored comes back to life in a completely new way. Often this inspires many of the practitioners to take a step back and take a different look at many things that they had previously taken for granted. Things that had been so categorized into a particular use case that we forgot there might be more potential within it.
Tricking doesn’t just need someone who can do Double Flips and Quad Fulls. Tricking doesn’t just need someone who can understand the terminology and teach others. It doesn’t just need someone who can hold events and push the sport forward in that way. What does tricking really need? Tricking needs YOU. It needs your viewpoint, your tricks, your presence. It needs your contribution, and if you choose to interact with it at all, you will make that. It’s all of these things that make Tricking Tricking. The coming together of many people who are expressing themselves through interacting with this art form.</Text>

            <Text>TRANSITIONS: SINGLE SEQUENTIAL UNIFIED
	Oh boy are there options, but don't be overwhelmed, There is a simple way to categorize these to make keeping track of them a bit easier. As we mentioned before &quot;Transitions&quot; are a particular type of movement that can bridge between the End state of one Trick and the Beginning State of another Trick. More specifically it is the movement used to reposition for the next intended trick. This can allow for the movement from one landing stance into another stance for takeoff. This opens up the possibility of movements available to link together. By understanding these transitions we can figure out how to get from essentially any trick to any other Trick, at least in theory, application is always a different story. These types of transitional movements can be described based on the sequence of their takeoff style. The options we have are Singular, Sequential, or Unified.
	Each transition category also has a simple and a compound version. The simple version typically refers to a sequence of takeoff and landing sequence that Land&gt;Takeoff while the compound version introduces an adjustment step into the mix. The compound transitions sequence is Land&gt;Adjustment Step&gt;Takeoff. The adjustment step here is a way to move from the current Landing Stance into another Stance for takeoff. This could be to position the Tricker in a new stance for a particular trick or to redirect their momentum for the next trick. 
	Unified indicates a landing or takeoff style where both feet are landing or taking off simultaneously. When referring to unified transitions however we are just specifying the takeoff style being performed.
	Singular can be used to describe a landing or takeoff style where only one foot is touching the ground, when used to describe a transition it refers only to the takeoff style.  
	Sequential refers to a landing or takeoff style where the feet land one at a time. When used to describe transitions it typically means that both the landing and takeoff styles both occur sequentially, either left&gt;right or right&gt;left. 
*** Insert Singular, Sequential, Unified Graphic*** 
	Starting with the Unified Transitions. These were the first types of transitions people were utilizing. The simple unified transitions includes Punch and Pop, and the only compound unified transition is Bound.
	Punch is a transition where a unified landing immediately rebounds into a unified takeoff. This typically looks like a powerful stomp into the ground using the floors rebound to generate power and height into the next Trick. In punch the stance does not change and as it lands in two feet can simply be described by the BIFO stances. The most common to come across is a Punch from Backside. Such as a Round-off&gt; Punch&gt; BackTuck, or a Backfull&gt;Punch&gt;BackFull. This can be a powerful transition to generate momentum when used properly although it doesn't have much variation to it, it can be used to consistently maintain the same direction of momentum throughout a combo. 
	The Pop transition contains a sequential landing followed by a unified takeoff. Or to put it another way, it lands one foot then the second and takes off with both feet simultaneously. You will typically see this as a step or a hop into a jump using both feet. This can be used anytime we are landing on one foot but would like the next Trick to takeoff from two feet. This transition does not offer a stance change however it does offer the ability to switch your takeoff style. 
	Bound is a way to describe unified transitions that have an additional adjustment step introduced in order to change which stance the performer is in. This could be a punch transition where we go from a Unified Landing&gt; Adjustment Step&gt; Unified Takeoff or it could be a Pop transition with an adjustment step so that we have Sequential Landing&gt; Adjustment Step&gt; Unified Takeoff. This gives the ability to go from any stance into any Unified Stance we'd like to use for our next Takeoff Style. 
	Looking next at the Singular Transitions. We have a few more here. Including Swing, Missleg, Rapid, and Reverse Pop for the simple singular transitions. For the Compound Singular Transitions we have Carry Through, and Wrap Through.
	Swing, when used to reference a transition, is when the in-air leg travels in a parabolic arc underneath the performer uninterrupted and is used to generate power and lift for the next trick. This type of transition maintains the same landing and takeoff stances and is primarily used to generate large amounts of power or create smooth combos. Swing chains are extremely popular, where a performer will use the swing transition over and over again with different types of swing tricks in between. Such as Cork&gt;swing&gt;Cork&gt;swing&gt;DoubleCork. 
	Missleg, is a singular transition in which the in air leg rebounds into the next trick. It could be said that the leg literally misses the ground and changes it's bath to create a new takeoff. Often this transition is used where a sequential takeoff is typically utilized, where the leading leg intentionally misses the ground and moves into the last half of a swinging motion. These can be used to transition from any singular landing trick into a sequential takeoff trick without having to actually place your in-air foot on the ground. This is often used to access certain tricks that would otherwise need you to be in a different stance in order to perform them. 
	Rapid, a singular transition that is extremely similar to the missleg. Rapid can be thought of as a one-legged punch. The key difference from the missleg is that there is no arcing motion performed by the in-air leg. As this acts as a punch it maintains the same takeoff and landing stance.
	Reverse-Pop, is a singular transition that will take the performer from a unified landing to a singular takeoff such as a swing or a wrap. It lands with two feet and takes off one at a time but rather than being a sequential transition it typically is used to get into a swinging or wrapping motion and is classified accordingly.
	Wrap, sometimes called wrap-through, is a type of compound singular transition where the performer moves from a frontside stance into a backside stance or the other way round for takeoff. For example, this could be from Hyper&gt;Semi or Complete&gt;Mega for Backside&gt;Frontside or Semi&gt;Hyper or Mega&gt;Complete, in the case of Frontside&gt;Backside. This can be used to change your orientation to your DOM in between Tricks while maintaining a linear momentum line. The Wrap often technically takes off in the initial stance, Hyper(Backside) and only finds itself switched to Semi(Frontside) somewhere in the Beginning of the Trick when the performer is already in the air.  
	Carry, often called carry-through, is another compound singular transition. Essentially a swing through transition that has an additional stance adjustment on the ground. In the same fashion as wrap, however the carry-through always finishes the stance change before the performer has entirely left the ground. This transition is often used to &quot;carry&quot; the momentum they have from one trick into the swing of a different stance.
	Now onto the final category, Sequential Transitions. All of these are sequential landings to sequential takeoffs. These transitions have essentially two patterns, four when including the compound transitions. The simple transitions Vanish and Reversal are quite simple to grasp.
	Vanish, is a sequential transition that could be described akin to walking. It follows the pattern 1-2&gt;1-2. Put another way, it lands Left&gt;Right and Takes off Left&gt;Right. It could also land Right&gt;Left and then takeoff Right&gt;Left, as long as it maintains this First in, First out order. The vanish transition is commonly used in many combos, particularly to transition into and out of Vert Kicks from otherwise generally inverted tricks.
	Reversal, is very similar to the vanish however it changes the order to be that of First In, Last Out. Where it is taking of in the reverse order of its landing sequence. Following the pattern 1-2&gt;2-1, it lands Left&gt;Right and takes off Right&gt;Left or it could land Right&gt;Left and then take off Left&gt;Right. These can be used as a way to transition between two sequential takeoff tricks that have a different take-off order from the way that was landed. Such as a landing of Left&gt;Right but wanting to take off into an Aerial style trick which takes off Right&gt;Left.  
	The compound sequential transitions add an adjustment step in between the landing and takeoff. This allows for the movement from frontside stances to the backside stances or vice versa. Other places have named the next two transitions differently which I believe adds to unnecessary confusion. We will be calling these Skip Vanish, and Skip Reversal. 
	Skip Vanish, often just referred to as skip, is exactly as it sounds. A vanish transition that has an adjustment step. This means it would land 1-2&gt; Adjustment Step&gt; 1-2. Allowing the practitioner to vanish in one stance and out another.
	Skip Reversal, is often referred to as Redirect, and is just a reversal with an adjustment step in between the landing and takeoff. This would be landing 1-2&gt;Adjustment Step&gt;2-1, meaning that it would land left&gt;right perform an adjustment step and then takeoff in right&gt;left.
	 That covers them all. Well... essentially. These too can be variated upon in certain ways but we won't explore that at length here. What we just covered is sufficient for us to move from any Trick to any other Trick with what we now know. A quick recap. We covered the Unified Transitions, which include Pop, Punch, and Bound. Then the Singular Transitions, which include Swing, Missleg, Rapid, Wrap, and Carry-thru. Finishing up we went over the Sequential Transitions covering the Vanish and Reversal as well as their Skip Vanish, and Skip Reversal counterparts. 
	With this we now have a proper baseline for the framework of Tricks to fit into. Had we just wanted to learn the moves there are simpler ways, certainly. But what we are working towards here is a deeper understanding of the system as a whole, that is formed by all of these pieces working together, out of which the individual Tricks were themselves discovered. It was only after so many of these tricks had been discovered by individuals learning these movements one by one, unpacking those russian nesting dolls that we mentioned before that led us to where we are now.</Text>

            <Title>Caveat about Terms</Title>
            <Text>A quick caveat about Terminology before we dive into the deep end. In all domains of interest, not just Tricking, the terminology that is widely used will have variances within it. Sometimes even full on discrepancies with the already functioning systems that predated them. These different schools of thought, as they are often called, will sometimes use different words to refer to similar processes taking place, or occasionally they will use similar terms to describe altogether different processes. 
We often attribute this variation due to a lack of communications between the originators of these ideas when they agree on process but not the term; or to different viewpoints on what is correct when they disagree on process but will use a similar term. In either case there is one consistent thing, the words used to describe the process are actually irrelevant outside of communicating to another individual something about that process that you cannot show. The reality is always packed with “more” information than any term we use to describe the process. The nuances are something that only the experienced can fully interact with while the process is unfolding. The term itself is just an approximation.
We may refer to a Trick using a particular name but that is not necessarily saying that is the only way to describe that particular Trick. Or if we were to watch a video of someone doing a particular Trick and then gave it the label of say, Corkscrew. We are not saying that the way this one person moved is the definitive criteria for any other Corkscrew. What we are actually doing is giving it a category of “is like” that has a few loose pieces of criteria. Within those loose parameters there is a ton of room for variance that would still meet the base criteria to describe something as a Corkscrew. 
These categories that we build around things are relative and usually divided based on what is easiest for us to differentiate things when communicating. Because these relationships of words to the experience of reality are relative ,the boundaries between them are more fluid and can be played with. Think of the categories we use less like cut off boxes containing definitely separate things and more like one box with some surface dividers in it. We can think of a swimming pool with lane lines dividing it up. We will often say things like “there are 6 lanes and we are going to Swim in lane 4” as if this lane 4 actually existed as a separate section of the water that limits us from the other lanes. However if we were to do a flip turn and push off incorrectly, or by choice, we could easily find ourselves in the category of lane 3 or 5. The lane lines only divide things at the surface level for sake of convenience in communicating, the water itself is comprised a much more flowing reality and we can move freely within it.
The terms are useful however, they give us orientation and a framework to play within. A place to start manipulating or enacting what we want to happen. Take the example of the pool again. We have a goal, to improve our swimming speed. So we decide to swim x number of laps and time ourselves. Well first we would have to know what a lap is. So we define a lap, stating that it is two lengths of the pool. That measurement can then be utilized to know how much distance we have covered. Now we have the ability to time ourselves and compare our progression to ourselves consistently. We can also use this to compare ourselves to others operating within the same framework. These constraints we are all abiding by allow for more accurate comparison and analysis to be performed.
The categories, like the lane lines, don’t actually separate reality into different things but give us ways to describe and orient ourselves with others towards that piece of the process as it unfolds. It really is just a dynamic process, one that at any point could be morphed and changed into another one of the categories we use to describe things.
This understanding of the malleability of Tricking typically only comes together after many of the individual parts have been mapped into a model, and the boundaries between them explored. It often happens after months or years of interacting with the Tricking ecosystem and is one of the things that makes Tricking so interesting. 
It's also important to note that this book is in a linear format, however a complex system like Tricking can not easily be laid out into a straight line. So in order for us to get the full picture we will need to continue to weave our way around the Tricking ecosystem in a non-linear fashion slowly building up an understanding of this system and its interactions.   </Text>

            <Title>Axes</Title>
            <Text>	Before we can start to discuss the variations to these base inverts there is one more piece of the puzzle we need to understand and that is the axes. In the photo below we can see the three main axes. For our model we will be using a Z is forward approach. Where X is the Horizontal, Y is the Vertical, and Z is the forward/backward direction. This set of axes belongs to the local world space. This can be thought of as the x, y, and z axes that are &quot;attached&quot; to our bodies when we move. The local world space is contained within the global world space. This is the x, y, and z axes that are static to the environment and we can move within. Both of these world spaces work together allowing for a range of movements within them. 
	The red circle shows the rotation around the x-axis this is the axis we flip around. The green circle shows the rotation around the y axis, this is the axis that we rotate around when twisting. The blue circle shows us the rotation around the z-axis and is where the angle of our flips can be manipulated. It's the rotation angle around this z-axis that allows for flatspin to be generated around the y axis. Flatspin is when there is a degree of rotation around the global Y-axis in relation to the performer.
	Each of these elements, Flip, Rotation, Angle of flip, and Flatspin are in a constant balancing act with each other. Where if we change one the other parameters will change in response. It's the combination of these elements that allow us to describe the Axes in the way we do within Tricking. In most disciplines, the path of an axis is locked to rotate around its origin. Within Tricking when we describe the axis of a Trick we are describing the interplay between all of these elements and axes in one motion. 
	We refer to the Axis often by which Trick takes that path. Using the terms like Flip, Cork, Aerial, BTwist, Raiz, Alien, Vert Kick, Laid Back Kick. For the base inverts each of these descriptors is giving us information about the Flip, Psuedo-Rotation(discussed later), Angle of Flip, and Flatspin. We use these descriptors because they allow for more information to be shared within a simple term. Each axis referenced within Tricking has more than one freedom of movement, meaning it is not restricted to rotating around one axis at a time. It can combine the axes at varying rates. This gives us the ability to create some very unique paths through space.

            <Title>Adding Detail</Title>
            <Text>Up to this point we have been looking at things from a very broad and over arching view. In order for us to move forward though, we will have to start exploring some of the more specific elements at play here. Learning some of the Tricking terminology will be necessary for us to make sense of some of the later contents. Each additional piece of detail will enhance the overall maps we have of these things. All of which will allow us a more complete understanding that is less and less an approximation. Every detail refining further; combining with all of the associated attributes and giving clearer boundaries. These amorphous movements start to take form.  
This is much the way we will encounter these things if we were coming to them as a new tricker. We pick a Trick and drill into it’s fundamentals. Learning along the way any associated terminology that may be relevant for us to understand what movements we are actually supposed to be performing. Before we know it, we have developed this very rich vocabulary we can use to discuss and describe many of the pieces of the Trick we are working on acquiring. 
Not everyone will choose to focus on the &quot;proper names&quot; of things. Many are able to simply mirror the motions they see others performing and tailor those movements to their own bodies. As we will continue to drill home throughout this book, the names of things are just pointers to the process that is unfolding in the trick at particular times. Regardless of what individuals call these things there is some consistency in the way in which these things are explored first hand. In the case of this book we will be using as consistent of a Terminology set as we can to make things easier on the reader. </Text>
