            <Title>Intro</Title>
            <Text>If you are reading this it means that you or someone that you care about has become interested in something called, “Tricking”. You (or they) most likely are trying to understand more fully what this thing is and what, if any, importance it has. I will do my best to keep things as explicit as possible and not leave too many descriptions to be understood only by those who have experienced them first hand, although there is no substitute for first-hand experience. 
Letter to the Trickers
First I feel it’s important to state that you’re not crazy for not being able to explain why this thing is remarkable, when you know, down to your core, there is something deeper here that evades communication. Some things tap into a different part of human experience that step outside of our typical categorical ways of describing the world. Language becomes the barrier to sharing the way you feel about it. It becomes ineffable. Sometimes it may feel like it would be easier to take the feeling out of your chest and give it to the person you are talking with so they can just experience it themselves to understand. Unfortunately for us it’s not quite that easy, that feeling isn’t a tangible thing, no matter how viscerally concrete it may seem to us.
To every one:
I hope the following pages give you some insight into the inner workings of Tricking, what it is, how it became that way, and why it becomes an obsession to many. Not only that but in some way I hope you have a better understanding of it’s importance and potential to be useful in a world you do understand (to some degree).
So what’s the book about?
We will explore Tricking. How we discover it. The problems it creates, and the ones it solves. We will be going over several of the tricks themselves. The ways they interact with one another. How they can combine in new synergistic ways; opening up our understandings of the Tricking “movement set” and giving birth to new movements and styles of movements. I will be focusing mostly on the technical and underlying aspects and less of the accomplishments of individuals throughout Tricking “History” in the following contents. While the “History” is extremely important I do not feel it is my place to try to depict that here.
I will also be going over the aspects of the Tricking Community and why the elements that it has are especially conducive to creating a positive environment for creative growth and pushing boundaries. We will explore the underlying psychological elements of Tricking and how they can be utilized in every day tasks for the rest of your life. We will discuss both the upsides and the downsides of completely immersing yourself in the tricking culture and, how to transition to a position of balance with Tricking when you have “responsibilities” popping up around you. 
Leveraging the tools that Tricking can afford us, we can become better, more creative, more collaborative, more open, and more supportive people. Only if we are diligent in how we engage with this amazing and wonderful thing can we truly realize the benefits, because like all things Tricking has it’s downsides as well. A great quote from Paracelsus that shows this idea well is the following: sola dosis facit venemum (Only the dose makes the poison). Which is even more simply summed up with the Circa Survive lyrics “The only difference between medicine and poison is the dosage” and that fact is true of our beloved Tricking and all of it’s many amazing attributes. 
There is an occasion in life for most every activity, the important thing is knowing when it’s time to do what. I am a firm believer that you are the only person capable of making those determinations. Unfortunately for many of us we struggle with knowing how to make the right ones, and struggle even more with wondering if the other decision would have been better. If you know how to leverage Tricking’s toolbox in your life, it is my belief that there is absolutely nothing, that, if you truly set your mind (and body) to it, you would not be able to achieve. 
Tricking fills us with a sense of pride and accomplishment in things WE have done. It builds a foundation of successes under us and shows us new perspectives of looking at things. It teaches us to teach ourselves in ways that “we” understand. There is a sense of independence but also of community, of competition but also camaraderie. Tricking has the balance of opposites that together tug at each other and create between them this phenomenal opportunity for something new and different to emerge. It is a constant making and breaking of rules. It is a pattern present in all domains and if you learn to apply the pattern to different parts of your life. It will all be Tricking. All the activities that you may find yourself interested in will contain within them many of the elements that make Tricking so special to us.</Text>

            <Text>Flow State - why tricking is uniquely positioned to unlock it 

Flow States easier to attain when you've attained them before. Even if tasks are unrelated

Conditions of Flow
1. Clear Goals = objective distintinctively defined, immediate feedback
2. Skills suited for the challenge
3. Action and Awareness Merge
4. Concentration on Task at hand
5. Sense of Potential Control
6. Loss of Sense of Self, Sense of Growth, Connection to something bigger than oneself
7. Altered sense of time
8. Experience becomes Autotellic (activity is a goal in itself)


Flow = High Skill, High Challenge 
Anxiety = Low Skill, High Challenge
Boredom = High Skill, Low Challenge
Apathy = Low/No Skill, Low/No Challenge

Flow, Anxiety, Boredom, Apathy are all based on your relative skill/challenge ratio not an overall difficulty

Flow is an escape forward into higher complexity.

            <Title>Performing a Hook Kick</Title>
            <Text>After learning all these terms and broken down pieces of the Trick we return to it with a new confidence. We think to ourselves: “With a more full understanding of what a hook kick is now we are surely ready to perform the move successfully. We know about all these fancy new terms and different ways of talking about the move. We’ve broken it down into all these simple steps and know the order they go in. We’ve studied loads of other peoples techniques and have figured out what movement patterns the best are using to get that consistency. We now have a much better map to go off when we are imagining ourselves performing this Trick. We are going to nail it for sure…” 
The imagined version of ourselves was performing this picture perfect rendition of the hook kick. Executing it well above our waist height, nearly eye level! It was perfect. It had a clear target, the target was spotted, kick chambered, executed, and re-chambered. Balance was maintained throughout the duration of the Trick and the body was in an upright position with great limb extension. The pivot happened naturally underneath the plant foot, like all the effortless looking videos we had been studying. Enter Reality. 
Unfortunately this is not what came out in our attempted execution. No, the reality was that of a leg flailing just a few inches above the ground, with a hunched over posture, hopping on the plant foot to try to maintain balance before falling over. There was no chamber, and definitely no re-chamber. The target was completely forgotten about and what the fuck was happening with our arms. This is not what we just planned in our heads. 
So we remind ourselves we need to break it down slowly. By focusing on each of the individual pieces of the move in isolation we can make those connections, developing our muscle memory so that when we attempt the whole thing again our body knows how to do it. There is a very focused attention that we discover in this process. A specific kind of perception called proprioception. Proprioception is the sense of self-movement and position of the body in space. Often referred to by people as air-awareness or body-awareness it is a sense that we will be developing and making great use of throughout our exploration of Tricking. 
This hook kick that we have broken down into parts, in theory, needs to then be broken down into parts, in practice. We typically start slowly moving our bodies through the attempt at a hook kick in a much slower way then the first times, paying attention to where the experience we are having isn’t matching up with the imagined version we have created. As we are doing these slow methodical movements we are paying close attention to the sensations our bodies are experiencing. Which muscles are tightening, which muscles are not doing what we ask, where is our flexibility causing us to fail? This back and forth of attention and questioning while we work through the movement is extremely important. This is the updating of those maps of the experience of the movement, with the imagined version we aim towards. We are learning what it feels like when we do particular things and how that affects the visual look of the movements of our body. 
This deep embodiment we are learning to experience, where there is a physical aspect of learning the interactions of these models, puts us in this very intense encounter with our shortcomings as they are literally felt within the body. The improvements that need to be made become apparent and must be addressed if we wish to make progress. Things like stretching to free up tightness; going through the movements of the trick regularly to build up a strength in the lacking muscles; and becoming familiar with the way these movements feel will all need to be done.
Each tricker is on a personal journey when it comes to each Trick. This means it may take one person only a few attempts to go through the process of getting the result they are after, while it could take another thousands. This could be based on the level of perfection these different Trickers are aiming for, or it could just be that some movements come more natural to one versus the other. This personal aspect of the journey of tricking will frustrate many as they are constantly comparing their progress over time to that of others. It doesn’t matter how quickly or slowly we achieve the next step, the reward tastes the same, Sweet and Delicious. 
At a certain point of us iterating these cyclical steps of attempt, assessment, and adjustment, we will find a certain experience of success. An attempt in which the physical experience approximately matches our imagined view which also approximates what we wanted it to visually look like. The experience of all these things lining up after many failures brings with it a sense of accomplishment and euphoria. We have finally done it! We set out to accomplish this difficult task of moving our bodies in this way and we achieved it! This sensation of pushing at a boundary of our capability, attempting this move, and having been successful, gives us this pride and a confidence to try something even more difficult. We are ready to explore tricking further!
So far we have been slowly zooming into more and more specific encounters the Tricker will have with Tricking and all of its inner workings, but we have been doing so from the point of view of learning one Trick which has relatively few components. We did so to experience firsthand just how complex and layered learning one trick can be. There are many terms which need to be learned and then mapped both mentally and physically. Those then need to be ordered, and applied with the right timing, all of which will come together in a successful execution of the movement.
Moving into the later sections we will start to see how each of these things complexify to become a very intense but still manageable system. As we build up our understanding we will find that seemingly intimidating movements can be broken down in the same way as we have just gone through.</Text>

            <Title>Glossary</Title>
            <Text>Aeriform - (AeriformMAT.com) Dan Perez TeJada’s system of understanding, learning, and teaching. This is the basis for many concepts widely used within the Tricking community however it does vary from some of the more mainstream naming conventions. 
Ambi - Short for ambidextrous. This generally refers to the ability to perform a given trick on both sides, but can also mean the ability to do a trick on the opposite side, See Darkside. 
Backswing: takeoff in which the performer’s leg travels from back to front in a pendulum motion, similarly to kicking a ball with an exaggerated follow through. This is typically used to initiate back flipping motions such as gainers and corkscrews.  Often just labeled Swing.
Backside (Stance) -  a stance in which the performer’s DOM is going directly behind them with the target at 90 degrees from there DOM in their default direction of rotation. Hips will be perpendicular. Left Twisters put the target to the Left, Right Twisters put the target to the Right. See Visual Glossary for further clarification.
Backside - Complete (Sub-Stance) - a stance in which the performer is in Backside with their Complete leg touching the ground. Left for Left Twisters, Right for Right Twisters. 
Backside - Hyper (Sub-Stance) -  a stance in which the performer is in Backside with their Hyper Leg touching the ground. Right for Left Twisters. Left for Right Twisters. 
Blocking - a term used to describe the transfer of linear momentum into a vertical lift. In many cases, the mission of the block is to translate all of the lateral momentum into lift, maintaining the energy but directing it upwards to use for height in inversion moves. 
Boneless - a description of the type of vanish applied when transitioning from a hyper landing into a cork without changing the line of momentum.  
Bound -  any unified transition that contains an additional stance adjustment step before taking off again
Carrythrough - any swingthrough that has an additional stance change either from Complete - Mega, Mega - Complete, or Hyper - Semi, Semi - Hyper. 
 Chamber - the preparatory act within a kick done with the leg before executing the kick, this form of pseudo kick generally results in a knee bent shape pointing towards the intended target. 
Cheat - Takeoff method where the Tricker performs vanish into a stance change. Typically from Frontside to Backside during the Takeoff of the Trick although it can be performed from Backside to Frontside. Rotation in Cheat Tricks will include the 180 degree rotation with the rotation measured from Backside. 
Corkscrew -  an off axis gainer full. Performed from Backside - Complete using a BackSwing transition, the performer swings their leg across their body while swinging their arms up to generate a flip and spin. The cork often incorporates some Flatspin in order to avoid a true head over heels inversion.
Combo - linked series of Tricks, completed in succession, these utilize the landing stances, as well as transitions between the Tricks. See Anatomy of a Combo in the Visual Glossary for further clarification.
Complete (Stance) - this is the standard landing position for Backswings, and ultimately contains two sub-stances within it. Backside - Complete. Which is your standard complete that is meant when Complete is said. There is also Outside - Complete. Which is where Lotus is swung from. Complete is often implied by simply stating the number of full twists performed. i.e. single, double, triple etc. 
Cutter -  a nod to the boxcutter, this suffix is generally used on inverted axis tricks in places of the specification Hyper-Hook and can be considered slang.
Dark-side -  the opposite side, or doing a trick with the opposite direction of spin from default. It is somewhat uncommon for trickers to utilize both sides, or directions of spin and when they do it is often designated by this tag Dark-side. i.e. Dark-side Gainer, Dark-side Cork. Etc. 
Double Leg - both a unique Trick as well as a variation. The Trick is modeled after the armada dupla from Capoeira. Taking off from two feet jumping into a pike position while rotating  Often described as a gymnastics “pike” position on the last half of a twisting move. Th

            <Title>Adding Detail</Title>
            <Text>Up to this point we have been looking at things from a very broad and over arching view. In order for us to move forward though, we will have to start exploring some of the more specific elements at play here. Learning some of the Tricking terminology will be necessary for us to make sense of some of the later contents. Each additional piece of detail will enhance the overall maps we have of these things. All of which will allow us a more complete understanding that is less and less an approximation. Every detail refining further; combining with all of the associated attributes and giving clearer boundaries. These amorphous movements start to take form.  
This is much the way we will encounter these things if we were coming to them as a new tricker. We pick a Trick and drill into it’s fundamentals. Learning along the way any associated terminology that may be relevant for us to understand what movements we are actually supposed to be performing. Before we know it, we have developed this very rich vocabulary we can use to discuss and describe many of the pieces of the Trick we are working on acquiring. </Text>

About This Template
When compiled (File &gt; Compile), this project will generate a document in standard manuscript format with sub-headings inside the chapters.

How To Use This Template
	●	Edit the Title Page document to ensure it contains the correct information.
	●	Create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, as chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter Subtitle”.
	●	Create a new text document for each sub-section within the chapter folders, giving each the title of the subheading you wish to appear in the text. You can nest text documents for smaller subheadings, like this:
#
	●	If you don’t require a foreword, move the “Foreword” document to the Trash folder. Alternatively, rename it “Preface” or “Introduction” if you prefer. If you would rather the foreword come after the table of contents—as is sometimes the case—drag the “Foreword” document and drop it below the “Contents” document.
	●	If you are compiling to the RTF file format or if you have Microsoft Office installed and are compiling to DOC, DOCX, PDF or Print, you can create a table of contents. Before compiling, simply select all the documents you wish to be included in the contents listing (usually this will be the “Foreword”, all chapter folders, and “Endnotes”, but not the nested sub-sections), then go to Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as ToC. Paste into the “Contents” document below the “Contents” title. The resulting linked text and page number tags will be replaced with the final chapter names and page numbers in the compiled document. You can format the contents however you wish, for example removing the underlines or indenting subsections if you chose to include them. You don’t need to do this every time you compile, just when chapters have been added, deleted, renamed or moved around. (Note to Microsoft Word users: If you export to Word, you may need to generate a print preview in Word to force the page numbers to show up correctly—they may appear as question marks before doing so.) Deselect “Include in compile” for the Contents document in the inspector if you do not want it in your final output.
	●	If you have no footnotes or endnotes in your text, be sure to delete the “Endnotes” document.
	●	“Notes” and “Ideas” folders have been provided for your convenience, although you can replace them or create different top-level folders for your research materials if necessary (these are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
	●	Compile your manuscript into standard manuscript format by selecting File &gt; Compile. The “Front Matter” folder is already selected for inclusion in the compile Contents pane.

Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to the settings to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
	●	Chapter subtitles: If you don’t want to include the names of your chapter folders below the chapter numbering text in the compiled document, go to the “Formatting” pane in the Compile dialog and deselect “Title” in the list of elements to include. You will also need to edit the title prefix in the “Section Layout”.
	●	Hierarchical numbering: If you require hierarchical numbering for sub-sections, choose “Non-Fiction with Sub-Heads (Hierarchical)” from the “Format As” menu in Compile. Alternatively, edit the “Section Layout” for each level in the “Formatting” pane of Compile and add the “&lt;$hn&gt;” (for “hierarchical numbering”) tag to the title prefixes. 
	●	Page header: You can edit the page header in the “Page Settings” pane of the Compile dialog.
	●	Font: You can use the “Formatting” pane in Compile to change the font used in the final document by selecting a row in the elements table, then clicking into the preview text to select it and clicking the “A” button in the format bar to change the font settings.

Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template, and you can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template.</Text>

            <Text>
It may even be more special to us because of the difficulty of explaining what this Tricking thing is all about to those who haven’t experienced it. There’s an element of it that gives us a sense of belonging to this secret club that only certain people are a member of and somehow we got invited. Much like the tight knit communities of skateboarding, surfing, rock climbing, snowboarding… pick any extreme sport, there is the crowd that “gets it” and the crowd that doesn’t, and much like many of those other extreme sports, Tricking too has some stigma attached with it from those who just do not understand what is taking place.  
This stigma comes from a misunderstanding. This misunderstanding of what is taking place happens because there is a consistent problem, on behalf of the participants, in not being able to convey the actuality of what’s taking place to those outside of the practice. Simple definitions are given without care and the “outsider” then takes those and makes their own assumptions without the proper context. 
It’s easy to misunderstand when each persons report on what Tricking is are largely subjective explanations. That’s why they typically default to a surface level answer that covers only a small portion of what it is. It is much easier for us to give fully, a partial picture than to give partially, a full picture, especially on demand.</Text>

The Problem = Lack of Direct Experience of the world, Filtered Myopic view, left hemisphere dominant. Disengaged.

Tricking provides an environment ripe with the ability to engage this way of being. Categorical breakdown only goes so far, the bleed between areas forces creative thinking to understand what is there. The theory to reality breakdown is evident. Re-framing of the problem is required and immediate. In the act new and creative solutions are discovered.

            <Title>Initial Encounter</Title>
            <Text>Tricking has a way of making you think it’s one thing while being another. The best way to understand this is to go through some of the processes that we might find ourselves in throughout the journey to understanding Tricking as a participant. It starts with a first encounter. 
	You’re watching as someone is running and it seems like they’re about to jump and do something but you have no idea what. As your curiosity peaks, you see one leg leave the ground, swinging upward in the air with arms flailing towards the sky as the other leg jumps to match it, as they lift into the air they contort into themselves in a way that generates a spin. The person is now upside down flying through the air, flipping and rotating around themselves in a way that can only end in a crash to the head, but as you continue to watch, they unfurl their bodies while hurtling towards the ground, repositioning with their feet underneath to land only to continue moving seamlessly into the next display of acrobatics, with seeming control and grace, yet a raw unfettered power being released.  
The first time we see someone catapulting their body in utter defiance of gravity, moving in this complex fury of precision and confusion, and coming to rest upright and uninjured at the end is something to say the least.  When we see this, a number of different thoughts will cross the mind: impossible, dangerous, marvelous, stupid, talented, I could never do that, those people are crazy, and usually, what did I just watch.
For most of us the first time we see such a thing we have absolutely no idea of what we just witnessed. The main thing we remember is that we expected one thing to happen and something else did. We expected a crash, but the person landed, we expected it to stop when they hit the ground with their feet but they kept going into another movement. We expected something but what was in front of us was something altogether different. Being confronted with this can be too much to make sense of for many, and it often simply stops there. A quick applause or shocked reaction, some utterance of amazement, and then we move on. We keep walking through the park continuing our conversation, or skip to the next video about something else. We get back to our lives and file what we saw under the category of novel, unique or peculiar and don’t think about it again. It’s easier that way.
For a few of us, however, an intrigue grows. We find ourselves in amazement and deep curiosity about what we have witnessed and want to discover more about it. We begin to immerse ourselves in the content. Watching, and rewatching, every video that we can get our eyes on where these people are seeming to defy gravity in these complex ways, using nothing but their bodies. As we consume all this content, a mental map of terms starts to be formed. We start learning the jargon this group uses to communicate about the particular activities they engage in. 
Learning this structure and the various interplays of these terms doesn’t happen all at once. It might go something like this. You’re watching these videos simply taking in all of the amazing feats of the human body when some movement or set of movements grabs your attention and pulls you in. You pause the video and go back to rewatch it. You repeat this a few times. “What is this move called…” you start wondering to yourself, “Is this even possible? If it is possible… Can I learn this? What IS this?”  
Depending on what era you came into Tricking, the specifics may vary, but in general you most likely went through a similar process of discovery. You started by searching Google for “Tricking”, “Tricking Tutorials”, “How to Trick”, “Tricking Moves”, or something to that effect. As you explored the various websites and videos a simple model began to develop. A basic map with various representations that have relationships with other representations. You started creating this crude map using the various terms you saw people using to describe the moves they were performing. The terms are then associated within the mental model with the particular movement that is being performed and you now have a rudimentary understanding of what a particular Trick is called and what it looks like when it is performed. As you repeat this process learning more of the terms, the relationship between the terms are put into more and more context as the total map of other terms are understood. 
Some of this language contains words we already understand in some context from other encounters we’ve had with movement based sports. Things like Flips, Roundoffs/Cartwheels, Rotations, Kicks, etc… These are fairly easy to fit into the model. Other things have their own proprietary bend that is unique to the Tricking community, and sometimes unique to local areas within the Tricking community. Things like Cork, Shuriken, Swipe, Hyper, Mega, Semi, Swing, Scoot, etc… Some of these words could be recognizable however within the context of Tricking they take on a whole new signification and are, possibly, a little difficult to understand at first glance. 
After a few hours of google searching, browsing forums, and the various websites that have attempted to create a Tricktionary, (dictionary of terms commonly used within Tricking) you finally find the one thing you began looking for 4 hours ago that you had completely forgotten about as you became increasingly lost down this rabbit hole. Whether you explore down this rabbit hole for a few hours or for a few months before you attempt to perform any of these moves yourself makes absolutely no difference to what will happen when you attempt them. What happens next is a similar experience for most Trickers. 
At this point we have some mental representation of a movement set, that we have seen someone else perform, and we have labeled accordingly with the terminology used by the community of practitioners. Our understanding of this Trick we now want to attempt to perform ourselves seems sufficient for us to envision the possibility of ourselves actually performing such a feat. We then take that imagined experience. One that we have created based on a perception and interpretation of the things we have seen others do in order to perform this particular movement. We then try our best to embody that experience we have just conjured. 
If you hadn’t realized yet this is becoming a really bad game of telephone. One where we have the first hand experience of the move being converted into an approximate understanding, by someone who doesn’t understand what is going on, using other people to give an approximate description of what the move entails. That we then take that approximation and try to make it our own by imagining what it would be like to do that thing before we try to perform it. At this point it has been converted several times, each one further and further from the reality of the movement. Much like in a game of telephone, when the message finally gets to where its going, it is very different from what it began as. 
When we go to perform the move ourself, the first thing we are confronted with as we begin this attempt is that we don’t know where to start or how to move our bodies. Suddenly the extremities that have been a part of us throughout the entirety of our being alive; Things that were uniquely ours and always understood what we wanted, whether it was to walk, or drink something, or open a door. These extremities always just behaved the way we intended, and that was the end of the conversation. However here, something notable takes place. We are confronted with a breakdown in how to move a particular body part to achieve what we intend. We have to go all the way back to the beginning of how do I move my legs in the space around me. How do I use my arms to balance me when I’m moving other body parts. A deep intentional connection has to be rebuilt, because all of a sudden the map we have of our bodies has just been shown to be extremely lacking. 
This jarring encounter sets us upon a new path of understanding the way that we embody our intention to move in a particular way. How we communicate with our own bodies is something that has to be explored and understood if we have an intention of getting anywhere on our journey to achieve this Trick that we “thought” we were ready to perform. A mountain of work has amassed itself in front of us and we are faced with a choice. Is this project, the one of learning this Trick, or learning any Tricking for that matter, something we are going to continue to undertake? 
For some the intrigue that grew past the initial stage is set to die here. It’s not to say they weren’t capable of overcoming such boundaries and challenges that have been laid out. Rather, that the project no longer compels their interest in the same way. Those of us who still have something drawing us towards this really don’t have a choice in the matter. The project in its complexity has a deep intrigue that takes over our mental space. When our minds wander it wanders back towards Tricking. Rehashing the problems we’ve encountered and wrestling with their difficulty. We are sent back to the drawing boards.

            <Title>TrickTheory Glossary</Title>
            <Text> 	•	Aeriform (Aeriformmat.com):  The main site for TKT users.  Aeriform could also be said to be a system of understanding, learning, and teaching, and is the basis for many of the concepts and definitions in Tricktheory because of it standardization and uniformity from user to user.
	•	Ambi:  Short for ambidextrous. This generally refers to ability to perform a given trick on both sides, but can also mean the ability to do a trick on the opposite side, also known as the darkside, only
	•	Backswing:  takeoff in which the performer’s leg travels from back to front in a pendulum motion, similarly to kicking a ball. This is typically used to initiate back flipping motions such as gainers and corks.
	•	Backside: a stance in which the performer’s chest is turned 90 degrees from the target, and their outside kicking leg is nearest the target. Generally, this means that you face away from your momentum while comboing. Simply stated, the performer’s back faces the way they travel.
	•	Blocking: a term used to describe the transfer of linear momentum into vertical lift.Â  In many cases, the mission of the block is to translate all of the momentum into lift, thereby stopping travel in favor of greater height.
	•	Boneless:  a description of the type of vanish pplied when transitioning from a hyper landing into a cork without changing the line of momentum.Â  (Advanced)
	•	Bound:  The secondary form of all Unified transitions.  bound follows the pattern of a unified transition, but has an extra adjustment step between the landing and takeoff. (Beginner / dvanced)
	•	Carrythrough:  The secondary form of the swingthrough transition.  carrythrough is any swingthrough performed with an extra pivot, or stance change.  For many, this is synonymous with a frontswing, though this has been largely discredited. (Beginner / advanced)
	•	Chamber: The act of preparing a kick before execution. This is generally seen as lifting the knee before the extension.
	•	Cheat (Takeoff):   method of takeoff where the performer lifts their outside kicking leg while pivoting up to 180 degrees in the direction of their typical rotation, and somewhat emulates a spinning hook kick. This takeoff can be performed from either backside or frontside stances, but is most commonly seen starting in frontside. This takeoff is commonly referred to as a wraptakeoff when performed from a backside stance.
	•	Crowd Awakener (CA):   side split, or straddled variation in which two inverted round kicks are performed In practice however, most circumstances where a wide straddle is achieved will still bare the name, regardless of actual kicks performed.
	•	Combo:  Multiple tricks or movements completed in succession.
	•	Complete (Stance): The most common landing position from the invert axis that typically lands on the performer’s outside kicking leg, with the performerâ€™s momentum pulling backward. Â This stance allows the performer to typically swing through into a backswing motion. Â This is the marker at which twisting tricks are measured as single, double, triple, etc. and is almost never named.Â  (Beginner / dvanced)
	•	Cutter:   nod to the Boxcutter, this suffix is generally used on an inverted axis in place of the term Hyper-Hook, and can be considered slang.
	•	Cyclone:   term used almost exclusively in TKT, it is aÂ variationÂ where the performer executes an outside kick followed by 360 degrees of rotation (Hyper + Half Gyro), and another outside kick. Â In mainstream terminology, a cyclone is a â€œdoubleâ€ kickingÂ variationÂ with hook kicks.
	•	Darkside: The opposite side, or doing a trick with the opposite direction of spin from normal. Â It is somewhat uncommon for trickers to utilize both sides, or directions of spin, so tricks done on the non-dominant orientation are referred to as being darksided.
	•	Double Leg (Dleg): Â Both a unique trick and aÂ variationÂ type, or position in the air, it is modeled after the Armada Dupla from capoeira, and can be described as gymnastics pike position while twisting.
	•	Double (Kicking): Â ThisÂ variationÂ is most often associated with any kick followed by 360 degrees of rotation (Hyper + Half Gyro) and another of the same kick.  nother more rare variation has two of the same kick on a target with no rotation performed between them. Â Technically, anytime two kicks are delivered in-air it can be called a double, but there is usually a more appropriate suffix to use. Â In mainstream terminology, the name of the trick begins with the highest rotation and ends with the â€˜doubleâ€™ suffix. Â For example:  pop-720-double.
	•	Double (Twisting):  ny inverted trick with two twists around the vertical axis ending at the complete landing position.
	•	Dub:Â   slang term for a double twist. Â Occasionally this term will be thrown around for vert kicks as well, but its most common usage refers to inverted tricks.
	•	Eagle:Â   slang term for the starting position utilized for backswings. Â It is characterized by the swing leg lifted behind the body and the arms back.
	•	Envergado:Â   fully inverted parafuso.  nother way to look at this trick is as an inverted raiz into a double leg. Â The â€˜enverâ€™ prefix can be used to note an envergado followed by aÂ variationÂ suffix, such as enver-snapu:  nd envergado followed by a full twist.
	•		•	
	•	Fake (Landing Stances):Â  Terms coined by Ben Atkins to describe an atypical landing position.Â  (Discussed Here)
	•	
	•	Fei Long:  n in-air kicking combination in which an outside kick is followed by 180 degrees of rotation and an inside kick to the same target. Â Generally this is done with crescent kicks, as they allow the hips to stay open and more freely execute both kicks. Â This is both a specific vert kick, as well as a variation type on both the vertical and inverted axis.Â  (VertÂ /Â Invert)
	•	Fei Long Cross:   specific variation of the Fei Long in which a hook and round are used.
	•	Feint:Â   faked kick. Most often, this means a vert kick is performed and the kick is only chambered, but never extended. The term â€˜Fakeâ€™ is often used to mean the same thing.
	•	Feiwrong:   suffix used almost exclusively in TKT to note a true-hyper outside kick landing in a backside stance.
	•	Flagella:Â  n old slang term for a round kick followed by a missleg transition into a btwist or aerial.Â  Contemporary wisdom argues this transition is actually a swingthrough that utilizes a frontswing, and not a missleg as it has been traditionally understood to be.
	•	Flamingo: Â Similar to the â€˜eagleâ€™ position, but in reverse. Â The flamingo is the starting position for a frontswing and is characterized by the swinging leg extended in front of the body and the arms raised up, ready to be swung backward.
	•	Gainer: Â Unlike traditional gymnastics, the tricking gainer does not require forward motion. Â It is simply a backflip performed from one leg, generally from a swing takeoff. Â This term is often used casually to refer to both the gainer-flash kick, and the gainer-switch, allowing for context to imply which is being used. Â The gainer prefix is usually used to note a swing takeoff into an inverted trick.
	•	GC:  Generic Combo. Â This is a relatively uncommon term that came about in reply to the prevalent use of the â€˜OCâ€™, or Original Combo, term to describe combos that lack any real imagination or creativity. Â Simply put, GCâ€™s have been done so often by so many people that they are almost compulsory routines.
	•	Grab: Â Similar to board sports, it is simply the act of grabbing a part of the body, generally the leg or feet, with the hand.
	•	Grandmaster:Â   trick performed from a master swing where the hands do not touch the ground. Â For example, a masterswipe without landing on the hands becomes a grandmasterswipe.
	•	Gyro: Â Both a specific and general term for an addedÂ 360 degree spinÂ or twist after a kick. Â Gyro is generally used for vertical tricks, and implies that the extra rotation occurs with the performer upright, after a hyper. Â It is not uncommon for some people to also use the gyro tag to describe a vertical twistÂ on the way downÂ from inverted tricks as well. Â Within the vert kicking realm, Gyro can also be divided into Half-Gyro, for 180 degree rotations after a hyper. Â Many mainstream (terminology) users do not use specific rotational degrees, nor the term Half-Gyro, allowing any substantial rotation near 360 degrees post-kick to bare the Gyro suffix.  mong TKT users, a true hyper-gyro is 540 degrees of rotation after a kick (180 for the hyper + 360 for the gyro).
	•	Gyroknife:Â   specific trick, and a type ofÂ variationÂ on the knife pattern, gyroknifes have an entire 540 degrees of rotation (Hyper + Gyro) between the inside kick and outside kick, rather than the standard 180 degrees.
	•	Half-Gyro: Â See Gyro. An additionalÂ 180 degreesÂ of rotation after a hyper.
	•	Hawkeye:   variation in which any inside kick is replaced with a hook kick. This is often looked at as a darkside hook kick because the leg performing it is usually used exclusively for inside kicking.
	•	Hook Kick:Â   traditional martial arts hook kick. Â There are many ways to perform this kick, but the general guideline is that the foot is turned horizontally upon striking its target. Â The contact point, traditionally, is the heel of the foot. Â This is often done by using the back of the heel, just below the achilles tendon.  nother way is to point the toe, and strike with either the bottom of the heel, or the entire bottom of the foot. Â Trickers often adopt the pointed toe to add length and greater aesthetic value.
	•	Hyper (General):  Originally, hyper was used to note the over-rotation of a trick, and landing on the opposite foot. Â While this understanding still persists, it is widely becoming understood to be more specific than this, and further disambiguated.
	•	Hyper (Stance):Â   landing position on the invert axis where the performer rotates past the complete position, and lands on their inside kicking leg, with the performerâ€™s momentum pulling backward or toward their inside flipping shoulder. Â This position typically allows the performer to wrapthrough, orÂ swingthrough into masterswings.Â  (BeginnerÂ / dvanced)
	•	Hyper (Vert):Â  This generally means toÂ land on the kicking leg. Â In the TKT system, this term is specifically a 180 degree rotation after a kick, landing on both feet simultaneously. Â This term can also be, and often is, used as a blanket term, allowing the following transitional tag to express the difference between a Hyper (TKT) landing, and a True-Hyper landing.
	•	Hyper-Hook:  variationÂ used on the invert axis, this suffix means that the trick was taken to the hyper landing, and an additional hook kick was executed before landing. Â This term is occasionally used similarly in vert kicking, but is generally a misnomer, as other suffixes generally apply better. Â Hyperhook is also a proper name for a Btwist Hyper-Hook.
	•	Hyper-Style (Vert):  landingÂ in which 180 degrees of rotation is performed after a vertical kick, but the non-kicking landing leg is still used. Â This is a term used mostly within TKT, and rarely heard in mainstream terminology.
	•	Inside Crescent Kick:  Similar to the round kick, but generally done with a straight leg. Â The key difference is that the foot stays vertical throughout this kick, and strikes with the inside edge, and arch of the foot.
	•	Inside Flip:   term used almost exclusively in TKT, the inside flip is a side flip toward the direction the performer twists, and is often performed from an inside stance.   right twister would inside flip over their right shoulder. Â The inside flip is considered the base flip for the Tak axis, as well as the master swing.
	•	Inside Kick:Â   generic term usually referring to either a round, or inside crescent kick.
	•	Inside Stance:   stance between frontside and backside where the performerâ€™s hips face squarely toward the target. Â It is not uncommon for some trickers to adopt the inside stance as their backside stance, and is commonly accepted as such in combos.
	•	Invert:  The act of flipping within a trick. Â In order to be a true inverted trick, the hips must reach a point higher than the performerâ€™s head during the trick. Â In general, tricks reaching approximately horizontal orientation, or where the hips are level with the performerâ€™s head, are often considered inverted tricks.
	•	Jackknife:  nÂ in-air kicking combinationÂ in which an inside kick is followed by 180 degrees of rotation and an outside kick to the same target. Â Generally this is done with a round kick followed by a hook kick. Â The round is often preferred because it more freely snaps the hips over, allowing the hook to follow.
	•	J Step:Â   common setup used for swinging tricks. Â The performer steps for ward with a variable number of steps, usually two.  s they step with their final step onto the outside leg, the foot is turned 90 degrees outward, and the trailing leg is swung through. Â The turn creates a â€˜Jâ€™ pattern on the ground, and initiates a torque in the hips as they turn to square themselves, increasingÂ power on the swing.
	•	Jujimufu (Juji):Â  The owner and operator of Trickstutorials, an early and extremely influential tricking website.Â  Trickstutorials is arguably the most influential tricking site ever, and can credited with birthing, or at least fostering, the early careers of many of the greatest trickers of all time.
	•	Katana (Vert):  Â True-HyperÂ inside kick. Â This term is used almost exclusively in TKT communities and is almost never used by mainstream users.
	•	Knife:Â  See Jackknife, and Swipe Knife.Â  ThisÂ suffixÂ is generally added to both inverted tricks and vertical kicks, and implies either a hypered inside kick or swipe was performed at some point, and that the trick will land with an additional hook.
	•	Kyro: ny hyper-hook followed by an additional twist or gyro. In terms of the use of thisÂ suffix, the hyper-hook is implied and should not be named. For example:  boxcutter-twist = cork kyro, not boxcutter-kyro.
	•	KÂ Step:Â   term generally used to describe a variation of the cheat takeoff where a slight stutter, or double pivot, is created on the base leg. Â This form of the cheat takeoff is popular among the Korean trickers and as such was dubbed the â€˜K stepâ€™, or â€˜Korean Stepâ€™.
	•	Landing Stance:  The position in which a trick terminates. Â For bothÂ vertical and invertedÂ tricks there are a multitude of possible positions, each carrying their own transitional possibilities.
	•	Late- : Â variationÂ usually followed by a number implying a kick type in mainstream terminology, this is characterized by large over rotation on the invert axis, ending in either mega with an inside kick, or more rarely by changing axis to twist vertically into n outside kick. Â The numeric value assigned to the â€œlateâ€ tag corresponds to vertical backside kick using mainstream terminology. Â This means that single-mega skills are assigned the title â€œLate9â€, â€œLate 900â€, or â€œLate-roundâ€ because their total rotation, not counting the flip, approximately corresponds to the backside900.  €œLateâ€ hook tricks will use the corresponding hook vert kick numbers, such as 720 or 1080.
	•	Mainstream (Terminology): Â The most common language and set of terms used by trickers.Â  Many of the names date back to the origins of tricking and sport karate circuits of the 1990â€™s. Â Mainstream terminology is more or less an oral tradition. Â Many definitions and concepts can be deduced from common usage and older sites, but there is no central location or formal standardization. Â It is a loose system with varying perspectives and opinions.
	•	Master:  lso referred to as a masterswing, is aÂ swing takeoff where the performerâ€™s leading leg is elevated and swings inward, closing the legs and initiating an inside flip. Â Tricks involving a master swing tend to bare the prefix â€˜masterâ€™, or â€˜grandmasterâ€™. Â The difference between the master and grandmaster is simply whether or not the performerâ€™s hands touch during the trick. Â In a master- trick, the performer will land on their hands before finishing the trick, where a grandmaster trick is completed entirely in the air.
	•	Mega (Stance):Â   landing position on the invert axis where the performer rotates past the hyper position and lands on the outside kicking leg, with their momentum pulling them forward or toward their inside flipping shoulder. Â This stance is 180 degrees past the complete landing stance, and can be looked at as a half rotation. Â Mega landings allow the performer to swingthrough into frontswing, aerial, and btwist axis tricks.Â  (BasicÂ / dvanced)
	•	Mega-Round:  See Late-.  Â suffixÂ used to describe landing a trick in the mega position with a round kick. Â This is more commonly referred to as a â€˜Lateâ€™ round.
	•	Missleg:  singular transition in which the in-air leg rebounds into the next trick.Â  It could be said that the leg literally misses the ground, and changes its path to create takeoff.Â  (BasicÂ / dvanced)
	•	Momentum Line:Â  The imaginary line created by a tricker as they travel during a combo. Â The momentum line is generally perpendicular to the target both in practice and in theory. Â Using the cardinal directions of a compass, if the target is designated as North, the momentum line will generally be described as East to West for leftÂ twisters, or West to East for rightÂ twisters.
	•	Murder:  name describing a swingthrough where the swinging leg was grabbed in the previous trick, and held throughout the transition.Â  For example, when doing a cork-rodeo, landed holding the rodeo grab, and swung into another cork, the second cork would be described as a murder cork.
	•	NASKA:  The North American Sport Karate Association. Â NASKA is one of the oldest, most prestigious sport karate leagues, and is one of the birth places of many of the tricks found in tricking today, as well as its early practitioners.
	•	OC:  Original Combo. Â The â€˜OCâ€™ is a slang term used to note any combo with a particularly high degree of originality, creativity, and often technicality.
	•	Outside Crescent Kick:Â  Similar to the hook kick, but generally done with a straight leg. The key difference is that the foot stays vertical, or toes facing up, throughout this kick, and strikes with the outside edge of the foot, also known as the blade of the foot.
	•	Outside Flip:Â   term used almost exclusively in TKT, the outside flip is a side flip in the opposite direction of the performerâ€™s twisting direction, and is performed from an outside stance.   right twister would flip over their left shoulder. Â The outside flip is considered the base flip for the raiz axis.
	•	Outside Kick:Â   generic term usually referring to either a hook, or outside crescent kick.
	•	Outside Stance:Â   stance between backside and frontside where the performerâ€™s hips face away from the target. Â It is very common to see trickers adopt the outside stance as their frontside stance, particularly when taking off for vert kicks.	
	•	•	Parafuso (Para-):  nother form of theÂ double leg, the parafuso can be described as a cheat takeoff into a double leg where the legs come together on the target. Â It is not uncommon to see â€˜paraâ€™ used as a prefix to describe any double leg variation on both the vertical and inverted axis.  rguably this can become a misnomer, but it is generally acceptable to do so.
	•	Peter Pan:   variation, or position taken during a trick, in which the performer places both fists on their hips, with their elbows wide, similar to the stance taken by Peter Pan in the animated Disney movie.
	•	Pizzaboy:  Â variationÂ similar to a scissor or helicoptero, Pizzaboys have been described as a â€œflashkick swing tornado kickâ€ in the air before landing.Â  The pizzaboy completes the flashkick or swipe before transitioning to the tornado, and can be added to any move with a swipe or flash kick motion. nother way to describe it is that it is a swipe or flash followed by a late/mega-round.
	•	Pop:Â   method of takeoff where the performer jumps with both feet simultaneously, and can be performed from either frontside or backside stances. Â Pop is also the name of a transitionÂ where a sequential landing is followed by a unified landing. Â Simply put, a pop transition is landing on one foot, then the next, but taking off into the next trick with both feet at the same time.Â  ( Transition:  BasicÂ / dvanced)
	•	Pump:Â   term used to describe the lifting of the knee, as if chambering, during the rotation of vert kick. Â This usually means the non-kicking leg will be pumped prior to extending the kick with the opposite leg, and can be used as a precursor to a multi-kick variation.
	•	Punch:  unified transition that connects a unified landing to a unified takeoff.Â  For most trickers, this is synonymous with a powerful stomp into the ground to create rebound.Â  (BasicÂ / dvanced)
	•	Rapid:Â  The secondary form of the missleg transition.Â  This is most easily understood to be a one legged punch.Â  (BasicÂ / dvanced)
	•	Rechamber:  The act of bending the knee after a kick has been performed. Â This allows greater control upon landing as well as the ability to kick again more efficiently and powerfully.
	•	Recycle:  slang term for a master swing, typically from a hook kick, into a vert kick.Â  Essentially, this allows swings into backside kicks without the need to pivot.
	•	Redirect:  The secondary form of a reversal transition.Â  Redirect transitions land sequentially, followed by an adjustment step, and takeoff in the reverse sequence from their landing.Â  (BasicÂ / dvanced)
	•	Reversal:  sequential transition where the sequence of landing and takeoff are reversed.Â  (BasicÂ / dvanced)
	•	Reverse: n older term used to describe traveling backward into a trick, or a trick that doesnâ€™t usually have backward travel performed with it.Â  This term is largely forgotten and is often instead used to describe a reversal transition.
	•	Reverse Pop:  unified transition that follows the reversed sequence of a pop transition.Â  Reverse pops are a unified landing followed by a sequential takeoff.Â  (BasicÂ / dvanced)
	•	Rocket Boy:   distinct trick as well asÂ position, orÂ variation, where the performer reaches down in a piked position and grabs the opposite ankle with their hand while the other arm reaches high above the head during an inverted trick.
	•	Rodeo:   position in which the performer reaches back and grabs their ankle. This is generally accompanied by pushing forward with the hips and arching the back to further emphasize the position.
	•	Round Kick:   traditional martial arts roundhouse kick. Â There are many ways to perform this kick, but the general guideline is that the foot is turned horizontally upon striking its target. Â The contact point, traditionally, is the ball of the foot, or with a pointed toe is anywhere from the top of the foot to the middle of the shin. Â It is common for trickers to use a pointed toe for this kick to add length and greater aesthetic value.
	•	-Round (Variation):  variationÂ where a complete rotation is made on the invert axis, followed by a round kick to target. Â For example, a cork ending in a round kick is called a cork-round.
	•	Safari:Â  See Rocket Boy.Â  Similar to the Rocket Boy, but utilizing a shuriken (variation), rather than a pike, or double leg.Â  The arm opposite from the kicking leg should make the grab to create the proper twisted position.
	•	Scissor:Â   slang term forÂ scissorswipe, but arguably less ambiguous. Â This term is quickly taking the place of Scissorswipe within the community.Â  Scissors are twist kicks, or â€œinside roundâ€ kicks performed with the inside kicking leg, and typically land mega.
	•	Scissorswipe:  variationÂ on the martial arts scissor kick in which an outside kick or side kick is performed simultaneously with an inverted round kick, or twist kick, with the other leg. This variation is most often applied to invert tricks. Within the tricking community, the only emphasis is on the twist kick, or inverted round. Â There is a growing movement to drop the â€˜swipeâ€™ from this name as there is no traditional â€˜swipeâ€™ involved.
	•	Seagull:  Similar to the Eagle and Flamingo positions, this is the slang term for the starting position of the master swing.
	•	Semi- (Stance):   landing position on the invert axis where the performer rotates past the mega position and lands on the inside kicking leg, with their momentum pulling them forward or toward their outside flipping shoulder. Â This stance is 180 degrees past the hyper position, and can be looked at as a half rotation. Â Semi landings allow the performer to swingthrough into frontswing, raiz axis tricks.Â  (BasicÂ / dvanced)
	•	Sequential:Â  This term describes a landing or takeoff where the feet land one at a time.Â  When used to describe transitions, it means that both the landing and takeoff occurs one foot at a time.
	•	Shuriken (Variation):  Â variationÂ type on the invert axis where an outside kick is performed while twisting, followed by landing on the kicking leg in the complete stance.  t higher rotations, further twisting can be performed after the kick and still retain the shuriken tag.
	•	Shuriken (Vert):  Â True-HyperÂ outside kick. Â This term is used almost exclusively in TKT communities and is almost never used by mainstream users. Â Shuriken (Variation) is also a type of variation on the invert axis.  s a type of variation, the term is used widely in both mainstream and TKT.
	•	Shuriku:  modern slang term for shuriken-twist.  double twistingÂ variationÂ where a shuriken is executed in the first twist.
	•	Single (Twisting):  ny inverted trick with one twist around the vertical axis, ending at the complete landing position.
	•	Singular:Â  This term describes a transition in which only one leg ever lands.
	•	Skip:Â  The secondary form of a vanish transition in which both feet never touch the floor at the same time.Â  (BasicÂ / dvanced)
	•	Snapu: Â Taken from the snapuswipe, this is anyÂ variationÂ where a swipe is followed by a full twist. Â In terms of the use of this suffix, the swipe is implied and does not need to be named. For example, aÂ full-swipe + twist is a full snapu. Â Like several other variations, the name of the original trick, the snapuswipe, is starting to beÂ shortened to snapu by many members of the community because there is no swipe at the end, as is implied.
	•	Squirrel: Â See Rodeo.  rguably not a distinctly different variation from the rodeo grab, the performer reaches for, but never actually grabs, their ankle.
	•	Stepover (Takeoff): Â See Swing (Takeoff).
	•	Swing (Takeoff):   method ofÂ takeoffÂ where the performer lifts their inside kicking leg while pivoting up to 180 degrees in the direction of their typical rotation. Â This takeoff can be used from either frontside (by swinging the leg away from the target) or, more commonly, backside stance (by swinging toward the target). Â This takeoff is also often referred to as a Stepover.
	•	Swingthrough:  singular transition in which the in-air leg travels in an unobstructed linear fashion directly into the next takeoff.Â  (BasicÂ / dvanced)
	•	Swipe: Â true-hyper inside kick, generally a round kick, performed while on an inverted axis. Â The target is generally high in the air, often directly above the performer.
	•	Swipe Knife:  See Jackknife and Swipe. Â The Swipe KnifeÂ suffixÂ is added to inverted tricks, not vertical kicks. Â It is similar to a Jackknife, but because it occurs in an inverted trick, it substitutes a swipe in place of an inside kick. Â This is both a specific inverted trick, as well as a variation type on any inverted axis.
	•	TKT (True Kick Terminology):   systemized approach to the study of tricking, founded by Dan Perez DeTejada. Â This system is widely known for naming kicks by their true rotational values. Â TKT is often synonymous with the eriformÂ system which is known for its systemized break down of all parts of tricking, from takeoffs and landings, to transitional definitions, and beyond.
	•	Tornado (Kick):Â  One of the most basic kicks, and often the first kick trick people learn.  tornado kick is a cheat takeoff followed by 180 degrees of in-air rotation, and a round kick.Â  In TKT, this is written as a cheat-360-round.
	•	Transition:  The method of connecting 2 tricks in a combo. Â Transitions are broken intoÂ several typesÂ based on the sequence of landing one trick and taking off into the next. Â Tricks such as scoots and cartwheels are not transitions, although they are occasionally incorrectly labeled as such.
	•	Triple (Kicking): Â This is most often associated with three consecutive, alternating kicks to the target while spinning. Â Technically anytime three kicks are delivered in-air it can be considered a triple, but there is usually a more specific set of suffixes to use.
	•	Triple (Twisting):  ny inverted trick with three twists around the vertical axis ending at the complete landing position.
	•	True-Hyper (Vert): Â landingÂ in which 180 degrees of rotation is performed after a vertical kick that lands on the kicking leg. Â This specific term is used almost exclusively within the TKT community, and implied by the term Hyper among most mainstream (terminology) users. Â See also Katana (Vert) and Shuriken (Vert).
	•	Tsunami (Kick):Â  More widely known as a stepover-hook, The tsunami name is a slang term used in the TKT and Cinematic/Hyper Tricking systems.Â  The tsunami is a swing takeoff, followed by 180 degrees of in-air rotation, and a hook kick.Â  In TKT this is also written as a swing-360-hook.
	•	Turbo (Landing):  two footed landing.Â  This term is relatively uncommon, but gaining in popularity.
	•	Twist:Â  For the purpose of this site, twist will always describe rotation on the vertical axis during an inverted trick. Â It is not uncommon for people to refer to any rotation on the vertical axis as twist, regardless of the performerâ€™s orientation.
	•	Unified:Â  This term describes landings and takeoffs as using both feet simultaneously.Â  When used to describe aÂ transition, it means that either the landing, takeoff, or both the landing and takeoff of the transition uses both feet simultaneously.
	•	Vanish:  sequential transition in which the landing and takeoff follow the same sequence.Â  Vanish can be likened to walking.Â  (BasicÂ / dvanced)
	•	Variation:  Performing any trick in a way that deviates from its base skill. Â This often means the addition of a kick or grab, or a specific alteration of the movement to enhance the aesthetic.
	•	Vert Kick:  kick delivered with no major degree of inversion. Â The performer stays upright throughout the entire trick.Â  (Vert Basics)
	•	WackKnife:  variationÂ on the Jackknife where the rotation between the first and second kicks is removed. Â Upon hitting the target with an inside kick, the performer rechambers the kick while simultaneously chambering and executing the outside kick to the same target. Â This is almost always accomplished by using inside and outside crescent kicks which allow the hips to to stay open and fixed while the legs are in motion. Â This is both a specific vert kick, as well as a variation type on both the vertical and inverted axis. Â In some versions of TKT, the wackknife suffix is used to note a true-hyper inside kick that lands in a frontside stance.
	•	Whirlwind:Â   variation on the Fei Long pattern, where the performer spin an entire 540 degrees of rotation (Hyper + Gyro) between the outside kick and inside kick, rather than the standard 180 degrees. Â This term is almost exclusive to TKT users.
	•	Windex (Windex Swipe):  slang term for a raiz hyper-hook.Â  Commonly understood as a swipeknife without a swipe. s such, many trickers choose to shorten the term to simply Windex, to avoid any confusion.
	•	Wrap: lso known as wrapthrough, the wrap has many meanings. s a transition, wraps are a often understood as a swingthrough into a sideflip.Â  The wrap term is also used in vert kicking to describe a cheat takeoff from backside stance, as well as to describe typical cheat takeoffs that rotate on the ground past what is typically accepted. This term is not without controversy, though it is widely used and accepted within the community.  (Basic/ advanced)
	•	X-Out (X):   variation and position in which both legs are kicked out into a straddle position in-air. Â This variation is generally reserved for inverted tricks.
	•	Zoot:  Related to getting high, generally from marijuana or dabs.

            <Title>Simple Trick Breakdown: Hook Kick</Title>
            <Text>Let’s say we decide we want to learn a more “basic” Trick like a hook kick. A hook kick can be explained briefly by saying that it is a kick performed at or above waist height where the heel of the foot leads across the target in its direction of travel. Seems simple enough. In order to perform this move we make the assumption that we simply, pick a leg and move it in the air across an invisible target with our heel side going across it first. Then we go attempt this move. A number of things could happen but they will most likely share a commonality, that is, it wasn’t what we wanted to happen. Our first attempt could result in a messy flail of a limb randomly in the air; it could be an aggressive extension of the leg that takes us off our feet, such that we find ourselves on our ass confused; it could be that we have an aggressive tightness in certain muscles we just tried to use for the first time. No matter which of these it was, it definitely didn’t look like the people who have been doing them for a long time. So what is it that those people are doing differently? 
We set out to learn the things they already know. We learn about the various parts of the kick and how other people have broken them down into their parts and isolated movements that are more manageable to learn. That another way to describe a hook kick is by establishing a few more terms to use to refer to its pieces. Elements that give us ways of orienting ourselves within specific sections of the Trick in order to know when and how to transition into the next. Some of these terms are things like Target, Direction of Movement (DOM), Spotting, Chambering, Re-chambering, Pivoting.
The Target is where in space the kick is supposed to be executed across, it is typically a point determined by the Direction of Movement (DOM). The DOM is the direction the body is traveling. It sets the orientation of a Trick or series of Tricks within a 3d space. The Tricker will usually decide, based on what feels more natural, to twist a particular way. Either to their left or to their right. The average person defaults to twisting to their left, however some of the best Trickers in the world twist to the right. Either way the orientation within the DOM gets established in terms of this rotational proclivity. In order to perform the hook kick when twisting to the left it establishes that we must use our Left foot in order to accomplish the goal of leading with our heel-side. This also, in turn, establishes where the Target will be within our orientation. We will want to know where our kick is supposed to be executed which is where spotting comes in. Spotting allows us to visualize where the invisible target is in reference to ourselves, before, during, or after we execute the kick, as needed. We learn that Chambering is the act of doing a form of pseudo kick or a preparatory position of the limb before it actually executes the kick, most of the time resulting in a sort of knee bent version of the kick. Re-chambering is the act of bringing that limb back into the Chambered position after the execution of the kick across the Target is complete. Pivoting is a way of manipulating our feet underneath of us to maintain balance as we are shifting into different body positions throughout the execution of the Hook Kick.
So then the description of a hook kick becomes a bit more complex and a bit more accurate. A Hook Kick  is then a kick which is executed at or above waist height where the heel of the foot leads across the Target in its DOM. The kick is Chambered, extended outwards across the Target, which has been Spotted and then Re-chambered during which the planted foot may Pivot to maintain balance. 
With these new terms we have an easy way of breaking it up into those pieces that can be figured out slowly. Establish DOM; Establish Target; Spot Target; Chamber: Pivot; Spot Target; Kick; Pivot; Re-Chamber; Spot Target. These actions become much easier to execute then attempting to run through the whole thing at once. Developing these muscle memories and associating them with the terms used within the Tricking communities allows for these ideas to “make sense” to us by breaking it up into more manageable pieces.  These pieces then allow us to form a more enhanced understanding of the Trick within our mental maps and all their interweaving threads. 
With all this new information we have received we can then attempt to imagine ourselves performing this move. Going through each of the pieces we have broken it down into, in our minds. Imagining a version of ourselves creating those same movements with our own bodies. The enhanced details of this imagined experience give us a renewed sense of confidence. A feeling that we “might” be able to actually accomplish this goal we have set out for. Not a certainty, but a bold confidence in a maybe; one that will push us to try it again since the last botched attempt.

            <Title>Evolution of Tricking</Title>
            <Text>	Before we dive fully into the complexity of categories and terms that we use to describe Tricking we should briefly discuss Tricking’s Origin and how we got to this point. It wasn’t always this complex. In the beginning there were only a few Tricks being performed and most of them were very commonplace within other movement disciplines. What was different is that they started being done in a completely new setting, in the middle of traditional Martial Arts Kata’s. Kata is a Japanese word meaning “form”. These “forms” typically refer to a series of choreographed Martial Arts movements designed to be practiced alone or in sync with others. They are used as a way to demonstrate, as well as cultivate, the practitioners mastery of skills. Within Martial Arts these are typically combinations of kicks, blocks, chops, and punches showing skills that are learned within the specific Martial Art the practitioner engages in. Outside of Martial Arts, Kata can refer to a “way of doing” with emphasis on the form and order of the process. In other words, a deeply focused, embodied practice. 
It is important to quickly note that moving the human body in acrobatic ways has been a part of cultures as far back as we have records. Manipulating the body in strange ways that resemble moves we commonly label as Tricks today were often used within various Tribal rituals. They would use these to invoke trance states as well as express themselves through movement, feeding off each other. These weren’t the only occurrences, there were also acrobats and dancers throughout time who were performing some of these body manipulations, although it wasn’t until the 1980’s that they would begin to form into what we call Tricking today. 
The precursor of Tricking was when Martial Artists started adding some extra rotation to their kicks. These types of spinning jump kicks were going to be less useful in an actual fight, however for the sake of performance inside the Sport Martial arts circuit, these were the perfect crowd pleaser to get some extra attention. These more technically difficult movements were catching eyes from the up and coming youth practitioners. Some with in the Sport Karate World were starting to add flips and other acrobatics to their competitive forms to distinguish themselves even farther. 
Large credit goes to Ernie Reyes Jr. and the West Coast Demo Team. This is where it really began for Tricking. This team was performing their Kata’s with increasing difficulty and flare to a wide audience. As more and more practitioners of Martial Arts were seeing these demonstrations where spins were added to the jump kicks, and acrobatics incorporated into the routines, the competition started to expand to favor these types of moves. So much so that it inspired Michael Chaturantabut, commonly known in the community as Mike Chat, to create Extreme Martial Arts in the 1990s. This was a tournament dedicated to the incorporation of these acrobatic Martial Arts movements that were less in line with some of the traditional ways of Sport Martial Arts. 
This new niche that was growing within the larger Martial Arts Competition circuit was creating waves. As more Martial Artists were doing Tricks then ever before and with the rise of the Internet, people started posting their footage online. At first they were just sending small 5-10 second clips to each other via email and other online servers. That is until Billy Billing founded Bilang.com in February of 2000. This became not only the go to hub for those in the know about Martial Arts Tricks, but the launchpad for Tricking as we know it 20 years later. 
Up to this point the Tricks being done were primarily Kicks with more jump or rotation added and some Flips such as aerials, backflips, and back handsprings. These Tricks were usually sandwiched between hand combos and demonstrations of particular static kicks. That is, for what was performed on stage. There was also an entire underground practice taking place after hours at these sport martial arts competitions. The people who trained Tricks would get together off-stage and have sessions. Taking turns demonstrating their most exciting or creative movements and challenging each other. Performing moves that were often unnamed and pushing the boundaries of what Martial Arts could contain. 
Many of the Tricks and variations that were being performed in the early 2000s came as a natural response to the rules imposed in the competition circuit. With the rise of these acrobatic movements being pushed into the competitive martial arts circuits the judges began limiting how many “gymnastics” moves were allowed, saying that each move had to have a “martial” intent behind it. It was rules like these that inspired things like the FlashKick, Corkscrew Kick variations and more. 
Bilang.com was posting all types of Martial Arts Tricks being performed within the Sport Martial Arts world and it opened up the audience to the entirety of the internet. At first the site was largely frequented by Sport Martial Artists looking to one up the competition and trade techniques, however there was also a growing group throughout the early 2000s that stumbled upon this website and began to attempt these moves with no Martial Arts background or formal training. Watching these “off-stage” sessions an entire generation was inspired to go into their backyards and throw their bodies in the air to try the things they were seeing. 
 This new group of people coming into this with little or no martial arts background would refer to moves however it made sense to them. Which was fine until people wanted to discuss what they were doing, or share tips. An agreement on terms had to be decided if any communication was going to be possible. Bilang was one of the first places where the terms for these things began to be debated online and “working names” settled upon. It was from here many of the “base” tricks started getting their names. “Base” tricks can be thought of as the starting building blocks of tricking. These are tricks that typically are viewed as foundational, or entry level by todays standards, although at one point they were the entirety of what made up Martial Arts Tricks. 
Another major contribution Billy Bilang’s website made to tricking was the popularization of the sampler format for sharing Tricks. A sampler is a compiled series of video clips edited together highlighting the most exciting movements from someone’s training. At first these were highlights from the Sport Martial Arts Competitions or the off-stage Trick sessions but as time went on backyard trickers started sharing their training clips as well. Eventually people would put large production efforts into creating these compilations to share with their online “Martial Arts Tricks” friends. 
Around 2003 Sean Cannon created Club540.com which is still a fantastic resource to this day. Originally It was created as a forum with an emphasis on sharing clips with each other. It was basically YouTube for trickers before Youtube existed. For the first few years it was structured with a free account and paid optional increase in download/upload rates. This was a Godsend for the backyard Tricks community. Sean made it quite public that he wanted to create a space where anyone could come to learn Tricks, removing some of the barriers that the XMA crowd were putting up. Debates within the community on various forums were taking place around whether or not Tricking needed to be Martial Arts based, or if the Tricks were required to have kicks. Now, if you have been a part of the community for any amount of time you will know that this debate is still taking place in certain circles. So with this new friendly approach to non-martial artists who wanted to learn some Tricks there were a few people who really stepped up to make newbies feel included when asking questions. Some of these people are still active in the community as I’m writing this and it warms my heart to see their consistency of a positive message a decade and a half later.  
Bilang.com eventually closed down its server in the mid 2000s due to cost of operating it with the growing popularity as it wasn’t generating any revenue. In it’s stead Jon “jujimufu” Call created TricksTutorials.com which became the new home to the Martial Arts Tricks Community. These non-martial artists started calling themselves Tricksters or Trickers to refer to the Martial Arts Tricks they were performing. TricksTutorials became the go to place to get tips, share footage, and in general participate in the community. People would use it as a way to link up in the real world and share the skills they had been training. 
People had used Bilang from time to time to connect in person but this was usually at pre-existing tournaments within the Sport Karate World such as the Charlie Lee Nationals. CLN was one of the “go-to” spots to throw down some tricks in the off-stage Trick session. TricksTutorials with its large non-martial-arts base became a place where Trickers began to organize gatherings outside of the Sport Karate world. The birth of gatherings came about in the early 2000s with the 2003 Toronto Gathering and they were not the tricking “Events” of today. In their early stages it was just a few random guys on the Internet who decided they wanted to meet up and do some flips together. 
Although the intention was just to get together with some friends to have a good time, these gatherings would prove to be foundational in the rapid progression of skill within the sport as well as adding elements that would make Tricking something entirely different then it had been. That’s because up until this point many of the Martial Artists that were training Tricks to perform in their competitive forms were largely focused on cleanliness and what would impress the judges. Now with these backyard trickers they were doing what was fun, or exciting, they didn’t mind if it wasn’t going to win any points in a competition. The only thing they were concerned with was “can it be done”. 
By around 2005, Sean Cannon had compiled the initial version of the Trictionary. It began with 100 Tricks that had been commonly talked about within the community, a brief description of the movement and an accompanying video clip. Nearly 15 years later and Club540.com is still one of the best Tricktionaries for any aspiring Tricker. It has since stripped off many of the original features of the site leaving only the Trictionary now with over 350 moves described. 
Having a central place with many of the Tricks listed out, with video clips, and descriptions, allowed for people to really view the Trick set that was being created and start to find new ways to push the boundaries. Discussions under these Tricks would lead to clarification of some of the terms as time would go on. With more accurate language to describe the moves they were performing, Trickers were able to share better tips and people with no training could really start to engage with some of these concepts. 
This new language that was beginning to form was allowing not only for people to discuss the Tricks that they were doing but was also giving birth to an entire new generation of Tricks that would come out of this. Having terms to represent some of these movements and ways of breaking them down into the parts that make them, allowed for people to start really puzzling with the various pieces. A wave of creativity was exploding within the scene as more people discovered these complex ways of linking moves together and adding variations to moves that were thought to be done evolving. Tricking was just starting to really stretch it’s legs.
It was around this time in 2006 that Dan Perez Tejada developed the True Kick Terminology often called TKT. TKT was a systematized way of breaking down kicks into their natural progressions. Utilizing the different base kicks, rotations, and various landing options to piece together the new naming system. It was a bit more cumbersome than the mainstream terminology however it would prove to be very useful to visualize the components that make up the particular kick based Trick being attempted. 
Dan Perez, Nick Vail and a few others tried pushing TKT out into the Tricking culture in the years between 2006-2010 however the system was not widely adopted. Those who saw TKT for what it was however, jumped on board and began to incorporate this way of thinking about their other Tricks as well. People were starting to see the bigger picture of Tricking and its potential. 
Variations to moves, integrating different movement influences into tricks and the transitions between them were really being explored during this time. People like Sesshoumaru and Kyle McClean were leading the charge and a wave of people were responding. We had things like FullSnapu, CorkDlegTwist and CorkSnapu being done. Variations now weren’t just for the end of tricks, you could do them in the beginning, the middle, or the end. Trickers were starting to open the doors for what Tricking was to become.  
What began as individual Tricks that would be sprinkled into the competitive form had grown to be a series of linked Tricks. These developing combos started with just a few moves in them with awkward transitions between. As the communities understanding grew, so did everything, not just the individual Tricks themselves but how many Tricks were being done successively. It went from small combos of Tricks with three to four main moves all the way up to these insanely long 15 plus Trick combos. 
As this online community of backyard trickers was growing quickly in numbers across the internet, the operating costs for TricksTutorial.com ballooned and would eventually fall to the same problem as its predecessor. The community attempted to crowdfund the website to keep it open but this only lasted a short time. Noticing the need for a community forum space, Dave C pushed for and moderated TrickSession.com. TrickSession began as an alternative to the TricksTutorials.com forum. Eric Benjamin created TricksSession after he had noticed that the forums on TricksTutorials were being overrun with trolls and the good information was becoming harder to find without sifting through irrelevant posts. The aim for TrickSession was a place to discuss techniques from a more serious approach and leave the bullshitting for somewhere else. Eric wanted to create High Quality Photo Tutorials with slow motion videos and encourage a deeper conversation. This was a place for Trickers for a brief time, however as other social media platforms began to rise there was an exodus from the forums as people took up YouTube for video hosting, and Facebook became the default place to link up with other Trickers, plan gatherings, and share samplers and raw footage. 
YouTube being the new home for Tricking videos gave birth to a new era of samplers and sharing footage. People began discovering this thing organically by browsing through youtube and finding these videos of these insane ninja flips. This brought more and more people into the online tricks community potentially contributing to the downfall of TricksTutorials. The YouTube sampler era was just beginning. Trickers started trying to say something specific with their samplers in this time. They became more than just training footage but rather vignettes into their lives. A statement of who they were becoming through the exploration of Tricking. Trickers tried to capture that discovery of themselves and put it out there for the world in one video. Through a snapshot of that series of moments unfolding. The process itself. 
These inspiring video scrapbooks people were creating invigorated the scene with creativity. The generation of Trickers that would discover it at this time would put a large value on the samplers that were more than just the Tricks. Trickers were suddenly becoming videographers just to enhance the way they could share their training footage. Making sure to capture b-roll of their lives surrounding the session time. And it wasn’t just training footage anymore. Trickers were going out of their way to curate specific Tricks and in specific locations to create the right vibe for their video. 
These productions became so intense that many took to releasing “teaser” samplers before. Typically showing off 30-45 seconds of highlight footage to get people anticipating the release. The most acclaimed Trickers often garnering thousands of views within the first few days, which in 2008-2011 was a big deal. The people who found these videos would be experiencing what we outlined in the beginning of this book. A raw encounter with this movement based exploration. 
Tricking for the last two decades had been mostly comprised of Martial Artists performing Tricks that came as natural progressions from movements other people had been doing. However, with the boom of the internet in the 2000’s the rise of individuals coming out of all these unique non-martial arts backgrounds came together to explore these Tricks further and in different ways. The backyard Tricker was slowly becoming the majority. By 2012 there was a noticeable shift in the community, the people showing up at gatherings were predominantly these people who had found Tricking randomly on the internet, people who had no idea of the history of this exploration and where it came from. This also created a unique opportunity, many of these people who were coming into it from outside of the martial arts world started creating a different understanding of these movements and how they relate with one another. These different maps that were starting to bud would lead to an increased understanding of these Tricks within the community. 
The gathering scene was also exploding from the late 2000’s into the early 2010’s, what used to be a few hooligans getting together and crashing an open gym had turned into weekend long events where the entire facility was dedicated to Tricking for those 3 days only. People were traveling from all over the world on a regular basis to participate. Often taking weeks to months off from their lives to immerse themselves within the Tricking Culture. What was once a few gatherings a year had turned into a few gatherings a month. By 2015 there was nearly a Gathering per weekend depending on how far you were willing to travel. 
Through technology and the intense gathering scene from 2006-2012 Trickers were spreading their skills and helping others push the boundaries of what the human body was capable of. Tricks themselves now had an expansive amount of difficulty and complexity that was added in a short period of time. As soon as someone landed the “Worlds First” the doors were blown open for anyone who wanted to follow suit. Scott Skelton landed the first double full swing double cork in 2008 and just a year after landed the worlds first triple cork. It was only months before the number of people who could land these moves were in the double digits. A few years later and there would be hundreds if not thousands of people who can perform what was the pinnacle of tricking difficulty in 2009. Tricks and Combos that were thought to be impossible, things that were literally joked about at gatherings among Trickers were now being performed, and on a regular basis.
This expansion of difficulty also came as a natural response to the increase in people teaching Tricking as its own discipline. Trickers were starting to develop various Tricking specific programs to slot into Gymnastics gyms and Martial Arts Schools all over the world. Certain individuals that had seen the big picture of Tricking made attempts to disperse their knowledge out into the world. Various formal and informal systems of Tricking started popping up.
One of the most pivotal systems that came out was brought to us from the same guy that introduced TKT to Tricking. Dan Perez had continued working on understanding Tricking from a more technical aspect. Trying to create a system with names for things people were already starting to play with. Around 2010 he started noticing that the system he was developing was showing holes. There was something missing. By 2011 he had realized that the landing possibilities were much more complex and there was a lot of untapped potential there. 
Aeriform, which had originally launched in 2006 as Dan’s Tricking coaching business had evolved over the years into what it became in 2011, the Aeriform Martial Arts Tricking System. He initially put it out on his website AeriformMAT.com after he had to close his first attempt at a Training facility failed due to zoning issues with the city and huge losses. With all the work already done for his school and no school Dan wanted to spread this information regardless. He also shifted this system into what he would market as Cinematic Martial Arts. This was a progression system he could teach to school owners that would facilitate the learning of the Aeriform MAT system. 
People like Ish Payne and Travis Wong saw the vision of what Dan was talking about. Ish was actually the first person to go through the entire curriculum over the phone. This was before Dan had fully created the video system to go along with the progression he was developing. Ish quickly brought the concepts into his school Martial Posture. Travis Wong had been running White Lotus since 2010 having coaches such as the Three Amigos, Danny Graham, Anis Shurfa, and Jeremey “Prodigy” Marinas, but Dan was offering something different. In Travis’s next gym project Joining All Movement where he was bringing together the worlds of Tricking, Parkour, and Movie Stunts he wanted to give Dan’s project a shot. Dan would move down to LA in 2012 to run the Cinematic Martial Arts Program out of the new JAM facility. 
When he put it on his website was the first time the Tricking community was exposed to the concepts of Complete, Hyper, Mega, and Semi as the 4 main Landing Stances. Nick Vail also released the famous Landing Stances for Nate Hitpas video. However it wasn’t until around 2014 when Brian Skinner launched TrickTheory.com that these ideas would catch on in the community at large. TrickTheory was Brians way of trying to push the ideas that Dan had pioneered and really bring them to a larger audience. 
Brian Skinner was able to take the ideas that Dan Perez, Nick Vail and others in the Colorado community had struggled to communicate and distill them into an understandable and coherent system. Taking time to make the connections between these things apparent using graphics showing the relationships between these Tricks. TrickTheory had taken the current state of Tricking as building blocks and laid it out for everyone to see how the pieces fit together.
This launched the next wave of boundaries being broken. At this point Tricking had solidified itself as something different from its beginning in Martial Arts Forms. It was now this pure exploration of every axis of movement the human body was capable of. It became this discovering the interplay of every category of movement. From ballet to ballroom dancing, martial arts to religious ceremonial movements, Trickers were taking influence from any movement they saw and asking how they could bring it into what they were doing when they were Tricking.
Tricking was now tinkering with every movement into and out of these Tricks as well as what was happening during, discovering where and how the body can move and what crazy shapes you can create in the air. With a solid landscape now established and a general language of terms taking hold in the culture anyone who discovered this thing from 2015 onward was on the fast track to getting good. 
Techniques had been refined, coaching methods were starting to develop and everyone had a camera phone in their pocket. Trickers were only a quick message away from getting feedback from the best in the world and they were taking advantage of this regularly. It was no longer a complete wild west of discovery. Most of these Tricks and Variations and Transitions all had names and criteria that was generally agreed upon. 
It was due to a critical mass of people asking Sam Kojo Plummer for advice on their tricks that actually led him to create Kojo’s Trick Lab at the end of 2017. Seeing the need for a unified platform filled with Tricking specific tutorials that covered many of the most commonly asked questions he was receiving. Realizing that he wasn’t the best person to teach every Trick and that actually multiple points of view on the same Trick from different trickers would benefit the community, he quickly enlisted the top Trickers from around the world to make tutorials on their personal expertise. Today Kojo’s Tricks Lab is absolutely the go to spot for a beginner coming into Tricking. What started as 40 video tutorials has grown into a repository of over 800 videos with over 350 tutorials on Tricking. 
What Kojo created was an evolution of what trickers like Dan Perez, Nick Vail, Sean Cannon, Jujimufu, and Eric Benjamin had attempted in the past. A streamlined way to deliver this understanding of Tricking to the average person who was trying to learn. Many ran into issues of being before their time with the ideas and platforms they were developing. Others just had too technical of an understanding and there was a language gap when talking to the rest of the community. However because Kojo was sourcing content from a variety of trickers there was enough diversity in the way things were being taught that there was a communication style available for everyone.
Tricking had finally stepped into it’s own and the communities understanding had mostly caught up with the few pioneers that had been leading the charge. The baseline terminology most trickers were using at gatherings and online was one that could communicate the nuance and technicality of some of these movements people were performing. In 2016-2018 more people than ever were trying to learn how to do these cool ninja flips and they knew to call it Tricking. 
Now we have an idea of how these moves were created over time but what exactly were they? What was this system that was developing through this exploration of movement. Lets go into some terminology to see the system at play. </Text>

            <Text>	So what were the Tricking “moves” and the general “move-set” that had been laid out. We will start broadly and then hone into some of the details to get a picture of this system and how it interacts with itself. Don’t forget to explore the Terms Glossary at the end of this section to get a better understanding of some of these Tricks as we will be moving through these rather quickly. I’ve tried to include some graphics that will help you to visualize the connections these various Tricks have.
 In our simple description of Tricking we have said that it is a combination of Kicks, Flips and Twists. We will now break these down a bit further, what do we mean by each of these things? Kicks, often taken from the Martial Arts roots Tricking came out of, refer generally to those actions performed with the legs during a movement. Flips, often taken from Gymnastic Tumbling, and sometimes Breakdancing, refer generally to those actions performed which cause the body to be inverted to some degree. Twists, often taken from all disciplines, generally refers to the rotational quality of an action performed such as a flip or kick. Each move can have one, some, or all of these qualities to them. So in a way our simple description gives a rudimentary sketch of the ways in which each move within Tricking can be made up.
	Specifically speaking, a “Trick” is a type of “move” that can be referred to by a name that signifies a series of movements the person will perform in a way that meets the criteria. For instance the hook kick we learned in one of the previous sections. When someone is Tricking, however, they generally do not perform simply one move, they often perform a combination of movements linked together successively. We refer to these movement chains as a “combo” or sometimes as a “pass”. Each of these individual “Tricks” (I will often refer to them as “moves”) are linked together with other “Tricks” more specifically called “transitions”. “Transitions” are a particular type of movement that can bridge between the end state of one “Trick” to the beginning state of another “Trick”.
 *** Insert Graphic Combo/Transitions  ****
Before diving deeper into the categories of Kicking, Flipping and Twisting let’s briefly discuss the anatomy of a Trick. We have at the heart of it what we will call the CoreTrick, this is the set of movements that meets the criteria to call it that name. The CoreTrick will also always have a Takeoff Stance and Takeoff Style as well as a Landing Stance and Landing Style. The Takeoff and Landing Stances denote the orientation to the Direction of Movement, while the Takeoff and Landing Styles refer to how many feet, in what order, and in which way. The CoreTrick itself can be broken down into five different sections that occur during the move. It has a Beginning Middle and End as you would expect, but it also has one more on either side of those, we will call them the Entrance and Exit to the CoreTrick. The Entrance is the very beginning of the Trick before any determining movement has been performed, this section will often be affected by the Takeoff Stance and Style. The Exit of the Trick is the very end of the Trick after all criteria for the CoreTrick has been met and the only thing left is completing the Landing Stance and Style for the next transition. Each of these various elements of the Trick can be variated by combining different movements into the various stages of the Trick. Once these pieces have been put all together we are given a new higher level Trick which can itself be put back into the process continuing to complexify it. 
All of the higher level Tricks are really just basic moves that were put through this process of variating the CoreTrick over and over again until something cool came out of it. This also means that if there is any higher level move that you want to perform you just have to work up the basic moves and do the small variations along the way to eventually get there. The whole Tricking system is nothing more than a bunch of layers of simple movements that have been pushed to their limits!
*** Insert Graphic Anatomy of A Trick ***

Now for a Terminology dump. The first category Kicks contains some basic kicking movements which form all other higher level kicking tricks. The most important of kicking basics are the Vert Kicks. The two most used are the hook kick and the round kick. Other notable Kicks are the Inside and Outside Crescent Kicks, Sidekick, Back Kick, Front Kick, Split Kick and Axe Kick. Twist Kick and Hawkeye are variations of base Kicks which can also still be considered base kicks as they can be replaced just about anywhere there is a round kick. It is out of these that all the higher level kicks developed. Adding rotation or variating the height of the body during the kick, how many hands were touching the ground, and the level of inversion to the kick. Out of this we get three main subcategories to break kicks into. The basic vert kicks we just described fit into the Vert Kicking category an then we have Ground Kicks, and Invert Kicks.
Vert Kicking contains its own subcategories of Pop Kicks, Cheat Kicks, and Swing Kicks. Each of these categories denotes the takeoff of each of these Tricks. Cheat tricks take off in a sequential vanish takeoff and perform a 180 degree rotation on the ground into chamber of the kick. Pop kicks take off from a two footed take off and jump simultaneously into the kick. Swings take off from one foot and swing into the chamber of a cheat kick. 
Vert Kicking is one of the few things in Tricking that has always maintained it’s two separate naming schools. There are the True Kick Terminology or TKT people and the Mainstream people. Today many people use both side by side for different reasons. Mainstream is often easier to rattle off in a conversation about many kicks however TKT really helps to break the kicks into their elements and show what is taking place in the movement. TKT can be a great learning tool as the naming is more technical and explicitly tells you everything you need to know and do to perform it.  Terms like Tornado Kick, 540, JackKnife, and CrowdAwakener leave a lot to be left understood. Where as the TKT equivalents like cheat360round, cheat360round hyper, cheat360round hyper hook, and cheat 360 split kick, spell it straight out. 
As we discussed in the brief history section it was out of this first category that the rest of Tricking built itself upon. It started with the traditional forms using the Round Kick, Side Kick, Back Kick and Axe Kick and adding jumps and some rotations to them. 
It was next that people started incorporating the second category of Flips. Moves like Backflip, Frontflip, and Sideflip are your pure flips and come directly from acrobatic sports like Gymnastics. (footnote. Which, fun fact, the term Gymnastics is taken from the greek word gymnos which meant to “train naked” due to the Greek acrobatic warriors that would train without their clothing or gear on. Gymnastics uniforms make a bit more sense now huh...). Acrobatics also had things like Backhandsprings, Fronthandsprings, and Cartwheels which were quickly adopted by the early Martial Artists doing Tricks. Over the years though this category of flips would expand to include many things that were much more than just flips. For this reason we could, and should rename these as Invert Tricks, more on that in a moment. 
The third category we discussed at the beginning of this section was Twisting and was incorporated into both Kicking and Flipping well before they started to be combined with each other. Adding rotation to a jumping Kick was where it began for Tricking in Martial Arts and acrobats had been flipping and rotating around themselves for millennia. It was only once the people who were doing Martial Arts Tricks started realizing that they could put all three together that we started to open the doors for what we call Tricking today. 
   To understand these better lets take a look at how we build things up starting with the Backflip, Frontflip and Sideflips. Each of these Tricks only contain one of the categories with which we described Tricking as a whole, that is, the category of flips. These are some of our base “moves” that make up the “move-set” that contains all of the Tricks. Each of these has a directionality to them meaning they exist within an oriented framework where up and down and forward and back have been decided by your DOM. Now, if you remember from earlier our DOM refers to our Direction of Momentum and just means the direction we are traveling in space parallel to the ground, i.e. front to back, left to right, etc. 
These terms are actually just sets of movement criteria that fall within a particular category, that of somersault moving in x direction. In the case of backflips its the backwards direction. Frontflips, front direction, and you guessed it, Sideflips meaning from Side to Side (Right to Left or Left to Right). In any of these cases we can see how the information is built in and tells us what we need to know to frame the Trick be referenced. 
You also have your variations on these, changing how many hands or feet are touching the ground throughout the Trick. Tricks such as Backflip, Frontflip, and Sideflip, have one footed equivalents the Gainer, Webster, Aerial, respectively. GrandMasterSwipe (GMS), Lotus, and Raiz are also one footed variations with no hands touching down in the move but these look less like there Flipping counterparts as they incorporate some degree of Torsion to the body. Torsion in this case meaning that the Knees Hips and Shoulders are twisting at slightly different rates. There is no “real” rotation in these Tricks although there appears to be. 
The ability for us to twist through three different cores of twisting at different rates allows for some interesting shapes to be created when these are out of sync. In typical twisting when you are trying to accomplish a Full twist you want these cores to be mostly twisting at the same rate, however in some cases varying this ratio can allow for the body to achieve positions that are very unconventional in everyday movement. 
 There are also moves such as Backandspring, Fronthandspring, Cartwheel, Gumbi, and Reversao that incorporate two hands touching the ground in the Trick and takeoffs or landings typically with Two Feet however occasionally with one. Moves such as Valdez, TouchDown Raiz(Left Hand), Broken Raiz (Right Hand) are all variations that incorporate only one hand touching down during the middle of the Trick. 

When we add rotation to these we typically do so in 360 degree increments calling that a single, or full rotation. This leaves the 180 degree rotations to be designated as halves. For example, backhalf, fronthalf, and sidehalf, refer to 180 degree rotations in a backward, frontwards, or sidewards directions respectively. The Full 360 degree rotation then gives us Backfull, often just referred to as Full as this is the default DOM, Frontfull, and Sidefull. Two 360 degrees add to 720 degrees giving us Doubles, and if we add one more 360 degrees that brings us to 1080 degrees with the Triples. This is the most we will need for most things but it should be noted that there are people who have added another 360 degrees to bring us to a total of 4 spins at 1440 degree of rotation. While this is extremely rare and currently performed only by the top athletes within Tricking, I don’t think it will be long before the elites will be adding another one or two spins and the average tricker will be able to Triple or even Quad. Tricking has a funny way of progressing like that. 
If you remember from the history section, the first Triple Cork was landed just over a decade ago in 2009 by Scott Skelton and now in 2021 it seems as though you encounter people able to Triplecork at any Tricking session you go to. But, What exactly is a cork? We’ve mentioned them several times now and unless you were curious and perused the glossary you might be thinking of a wine stopper, or when I said corkscrew you might have thought of the wine stopper removal tool. Neither of these are correct. 
If you recall back to the first encounter we described with tricking where we said, “You’re watching as someone is running and it seems like they’re about to jump and do something but you have no idea what. As your curiosity peaks, you see one leg leave the ground, swinging upward in the air with arms flailing towards the sky as the other leg jumps to match it, as they lift into the air they contort into themselves in a way that generates a spin. The person is now upside down flying through the air, flipping and rotating around themselves in a way that can only end in a crash to the head, but as you continue to watch, they unfurl their bodies while hurtling towards the ground, repositioning with their feet underneath to land only to continue moving seamlessly into the next display of acrobatics, with seeming control and grace, yet a raw unfettered power being released.”
We were actually describing a cork here! A much easier way to think of a cork is to think of a gainer full done off axis. Gainer tells us that this is a one footed swing into a backflip, full referring to the amount of rotation, in this case 360 degrees, and the off-axis part. What do we mean by off axis? Well anytime you rotate around a point, the point you rotate around becomes the axis. When we are standing up and down we can picture our axes going through us like the picture below. One coming from the Top through our center, this will represent where we rotate around when we are twisting. One through our hips that we can flip around or show inversion on. The last one however comes from a combination of our axis of flipping and the twisting rotation we are applying which gives us a flat spin.

            <Title>Each Path to Tricking is Unique</Title>
            <Text>Each individual Tricker is going to develop their own path as they explore their way into Tricking, and each of those paths are going to be unique even if there is some overlap. People may go through different stages of Tricking at different times, or not go through certain ones altogether. Some people may explore a majority of the movements Tricking opens us up to, while others may spend the entirety of their Tricking years exploring a limited few concepts. It is completely up to the individual how they interact with this thing. Some will stick close to the movements they are exposed to while others start exploring the bodies potential for movement from the beginning. This creates a very difficult to explain hierarchy of things; as two people may place certain Tricks in different levels of difficulty based on their experience as well as other contributing factors. Due to this amorphous nature of this hierarchy it can be very challenging for a new individual to know where to begin to explore from. 
The good news is it’s relatively arbitrary where you begin. I say relatively because it has potential to influence where your Tricks will go from there based on which area you start to explore. Typically this acts to our benefit more than it does our disadvantage because we explore the things that are the most exciting and relevant to us and what we want our bodies to be doing. By allowing the new tricker to explore at their own discretion the interest that develops is a deeper one that seems to create a drive to overcome difficult tasks lying in the way to achieving the goal (performing the trick). 
This is largely how people develop their own style. By exploring the things relevant to themselves people are not only discovering what they like and don’t like but expressing that to everyone that is watching. The things that subjectively “feel” or sometimes “look” the best to them are going to make them come alive the most and want to further push themselves in that direction. 
We can only explore outward from where we begin. And we always begin where we do in terms of what is the most salient to us. Meaning what stands out to us the most. Where was our attention when we were watching? Was it the kicks? Was it the flips? Was it the swinging off one leg? Was it just a particular body shape of a movement that we found beautiful or strange? Whatever it was is the thing most relevant to us after witnessing Tricking is typically where the exploration attempts to begin. </Text>

            <Title>What People Think It Is</Title>
            <Text>	So why do people, in general, think Tricking is just the physical movements taking place. It’s easy to think that Tricking is just it’s surface level contents. That is the “things” or in this case the Tricks or “moves” that make it up. I would say primarily because this is often the way it is quickly explained to people. One of two common forms of the “standard” definition of Tricking typically given are: 1) Tricking is a combination of kicks, flips, and twists. Or 2) Tricking is a combination of elements from various forms of Martial Arts, Gymnastics Tumbling and Breakdancing. </Text>

            <Title>Caveat about Terms</Title>
            <Text>A quick caveat about Terminology before we dive into the deep end. In all domains of interest, not just Tricking, the terminology that is widely used will have variances within it. Sometimes even full on discrepancies with the already functioning systems that predated them. These different schools of thought, as they are often called, will sometimes use different words to refer to similar processes taking place, or occasionally they will use similar terms to describe altogether different processes. 
We often attribute this variation due to a lack of communications between the originators of these ideas when they agree on process but not definition, or to different viewpoints on what is correct when they disagree on process but will use a similar term. 
In either case there is one consistent thing, the terms themselves, the words used to describe the process are actually irrelevant outside of communicating to another individual something about that process that you cannot show. The reality is always packed with “more” information than any term we use to describe the process. The nuances are something that only the experienced can fully interact with while the process is unfolding. The term itself is just an approximation.
We may refer to a Trick using a particular name but that is not necessarily saying that is the only way to describe that particular Trick. Or if we were to watch a video of someone doing a particular Trick and then gave it the label of say, Corkscrew. We are not saying that the way this one person moved is the definitive criteria for any other Corkscrew. What we are actually doing is giving it a category of “is like” that has a few loose pieces of criteria. Within those loose parameters there is a ton of room for variance that would still meet the base criteria to describe something as a Corkscrew. 
These categories that we build around things are relative and usually divided based on what is easiest for us to differentiate things when communicating. Because these relationships of words to the experience of reality are relative ,the boundaries between them are more fluid and can be played with. Think of the categories we use less like cut off boxes containing definitely separate things and more like one box with some surface dividers in it. We can think of a swimming pool with lane lines dividing it up. We will often say things like “there are 6 lanes and we are going to Swim in lane 4” as if this lane 4 actually existed as a separate section of the water that limits us from the other lanes. However if we were to do a flip turn and push off incorrectly, or by choice, we could easily find ourselves in the category of lane 3 or 5. The lane lines only divide things at the surface level for sake of convenience in communicating, the water itself is comprised a much more flowing reality and we can move freely within it.
The terms are useful however, they give us orientation and a framework to play with. A place to start manipulating or enacting what we want to happen. Take the example of the pool again. We have a goal, to swim x number of laps. Well first we would have to know what a lap is. So we say okay, that is one length of the pool. Then the question becomes which direction? Then how will I not run into other swimmers that have chosen a different direction. How do we all choose the same direction if we can choose either. So we set up constraints in order to do the thing with others. We setup the lanes by dividing them into section all moving in the same direction and then give them each a number to know which we are referring to. Now have enough to be able to go swim our x laps and not have to be worrying about every potential variance in what could happen. 
Other swimmers quickly adopt the same system as they quickly realize the pools lane lines make it more difficult to swim perpendicular to them rather than parallel, and more importantly that when they do the activity with the same criteria as other swimmers they can then compare and contrast things about how fast they swam x laps and know that they are discussing the same thing. 
The categories, like the lane lines, don’t actually separate reality into different things but give us ways to describe and orient ourselves with others towards that thing. It is really just a dynamic process, one that at any point could be morphed and changed into another one of the categories we use to describe things.

            <Title>Ask a Tricker</Title>
            <Text>If you’ve ever asked someone who participates in this thing the question “What is Tricking?” You were most likely met first with a long sigh and then some version of this bottled answer. Tricking is a combination of kicks, flips, and twists; or, Tricking is a combination of elements from various forms of Martial Arts, Gymnastics Tumbling and Breakdancing. While these do point to the visible action taking place within Tricking as it occurs, it does so only as a reference to the parts that it came from. It’s quite understandable that this is what happens because in general, there is no good frame of reference to explain it in any other way. Unfortunately this completely misses the reality of what it is. 
So why does this happen? When someone has not experienced something for themselves and we want to share our experience with them we have to point to things in our description that the other person HAS experienced first hand. We do this because that person can conjure up an idea of what those constituent parts are and try to bring them together. So in the explanation that Tricking is a combination of kicks, flips, and twists. Someone who has no frame of reference for the idea of “Tricking” can then create a visual concept of someone moving through the air in unique ways. This picture that is painted is always a mis-appropriation of what Tricking really is but for the sake of our argument we should continue down this road to understand why people default to this answer. Thinking of the “moves” that make up the “move-set” within the performance of Tricking, as what Tricking is, makes sense because in some way it “IS” this, but only in some way. I hope to make it clear how this partial picture makes it difficult to communicate the deeper understanding of what Tricking is and why it is important.</Text>

            <Title>Reflecting</Title>
            <Text>In this initial encounter we have with Tricking we are confronted with a series of opportunities to either continue investigating this thing, and learning it for ourselves; or to simply move on, abandoning the project in front of us. For those that do abandon it before getting to the stages of attempting or even investigating it deeper they don’t think twice about it. Other things are occupying their attention. On the other hand, those of us who continue the investigation do so not because of a conscious want or desire but from a pull that guides our attention back to this thing over and over again. It may take many encounters similar to the first one before we actively realize what we are pursuing. We just suddenly find ourselves immersed within this world of Tricking and are deeply engaged by it. 
As we are diving down this rabbit hole of information we are mapping these Tricking Terms to the visual “images” of them; and mapping these, to a description of the Trick; and the description, giving us information about its constituent parts; and how those parts, which are movement “chunks”,  are mapping back to our visual image of this Trick; developing a relatively decent approximation. Some may explore all of the terms they can find within Tricking well before attempting a move, while others may get only what they need to attempt the first one and just go for it. Regardless, a Tricker will encounter next a breakdown in their understanding of their relationship to their own body. No matter how well we imagined ourselves doing the Trick before attempting it for the first time, we always seem to be missing some element that we get confronted with in our experience first hand of it. 
After attempting to perform the move for the first time we are now afforded access to the realization of a gap in our knowledge and skill. Namely we don’t know how to move our legs and arms and not fall on our face trying these movements. We start to realize that in order to do these complex sets of movements known as a Trick we will have to develop an understanding of how to move our bodies in new and foreign ways. 
We then will begin breaking these Tricks down into manageable chunks of movement and working with our bodies to map to those pieces. Slowly training our experience to these various labels we learn and develop from and with the community of Trickers. These “Trick” names, terminology, labels, references, and descriptions we have for these things, exist primarily as a way for us to communicate to others, both our intentions, as well as our accomplishments. They are necessary only as a means for verbal or written reference to the actual movement embodied within the trick when the Tricker is performing the action. This verbal and non-verbal vocabulary is something each Tricker will develop through exploring tricking more as well as interacting with other Trickers. </Text>

Martial Arts Circa 1980’s Adding Flips and more complex kicks to make the forms more interesting. Ernie Reyes Jr - West Coast Demo Team. 

NASKA put limits on amount of “gymnastics moves” allowed in forms. They looked for a Martial Art incorporation which encouraged competitions to variate these gymnastic movements in a martial arts fashion.

            <Title>Foreword</Title>
            <Text> It was December of 2010. I was sitting at the computer desk in our den (family living room) watching videos of people throwing their bodies into the air and contorting them in the wildest of ways before again landing upright on their feet. The activity I was watching was Tricking. This was a normal afternoon for me, get home from school and plop down at the computer to watch more of these insane movements, studying them, trying to understand just what was happening. On this particular afternoon my dad walks into the den and pauses over my shoulder to see what I’m doing. Noticing I’m watching more of those “flipping videos” he asks, “So, uhh… what’s the point here? How do you win?”
	“Well, that’s not really the point, you don’t really win, I mean you can… in these certain things we call battles, but those are just sort of thrown together at the Gatherings by either the hosts or just people that want to challenge each other for fun! You kind of win against yourself in way I guess just like doing new things.” 
	“So there aren’t any like organized competitions for money or leagues or anything like that?” He said looking visibly confused at what this thing is, and why his son had been obsessing about it for the last 8 months.
	“Not like the NBA or NFL or anything but it’s still really new and not that many people know about it but it is really growing fast! So, maybe we will see something like that one day. Who knows?” I said, trying to get him excited about the idea.
	“So then what’s this EPIC Gathering thing you are going to with Hunter next weekend? Is that not a competition? And if there isn’t a competition, again what’s the point. Why do you practice if you aren’t doing it to compete? For example, in gymnastics, or cheerleading, or football, or any other sport if you practice its so you can demonstrate those skills to show how you compare to the other people who also practice those skills, right? So if it’s a “sport” why would there be no competition?” He sighed not understanding.
	“It’s called a Gathering, its where a bunch of people who Trick come from all over the world to get together in a gym that someone rents out and we can Trick together and people share techniques and just hang out for the weekend. And like I said they have battles but they aren’t like “organized” by some agency or anything it’s just basically a bunch of people that like this thing that go to the same place to do the thing they like.” I replied, most likely visibly frustrated.
	“But I still don’t get the point of it, other than it’s just fun. I’m just trying to understand why it’s so important to you.”
I opened my mouth, then slowly shut it again. I didn’t quite have the right answer for the question he was actually trying to ask. I forget exactly how the conversation went on from there but I remember leaving it feeling frustrated like a typical teenager whose “parents just don’t understand”. In hindsight though I realize that my dad was genuinely trying to understand what it was that I was doing. More specifically what I was spending all of my time and money on. It was this conversation where the seed for this book was planted. Although I didn’t realize it at the time. 
My parent’s were always supportive of the things I did, including Tricking, but for some reason they just couldn’t wrap their heads around what Tricking actually was. And as it turns out, I wasn’t very good at explaining to them what it was in a way that they could understand. Some variation of this conversation of “what is it” and “what’s the point” would take place many times over the next few years as I became more and more active and involved with the community as a whole.
 Over the years a lot happened with Tricking and my life. In May of 2011, Rudy Meadows and I formed a company called Torque Tricking (on a whim the first time we hung out, but that’s a different story). We started going to every single event we could make it to. At one point when I counted it, we had been to 22 Tricking Gatherings in just under 2 years. It was around then that I stopped counting. After going to a quite a few from 2011-2012 we decided to have our own and fly out some Trickers for a little mini gathering. We called it TorqueMiniGathering. It was during an experience I had at this gathering that the seed for this book sprouted, and began to grow.
We were sitting in my living room talking about Tricking. To set the scene, I believe it was myself, Rudy Meadows, Hunter Mood, Kyle Butto, Alex Kerwood, Zach Kenney, Norman Storer, Tyler Wilson (A.K.A. Kite Tricking), Nick Vail, and Charlie Grenhart. My parents and siblings then joined the room and the conversation, at first listening and then beginning to ask the same old questions trying to grasp at why all this jumping around mattered so much to us. It was at this point when I watched as each of my friends struggled in exactly the same way as I did when trying to convey the power and importance this activity has to each of us. 
It was at that point, as I recall, that I began grappling with that question. I remember it eating away at me for weeks and weeks after that encounter (perhaps years). Why was it that we could talk to each other about this thing, in practically gibberish, and know that the other person was understanding exactly why we loved Tricking and why it was important to us; but for some reason, no matter what we tried, we could NOT explain it to someone who hadn’t experienced it in the way that we had. It was that problem that led me to asking many of the questions that I did over the last 8 years. And it is now after those 8 years that I feel I am ready to give it my best attempt in the following work to describe what Tricking is and why I let it take over my life and I do not regret a single second of it. 
I’m writing this for the Trickers struggling to explain to their friends and family that Tricking isn’t just play. I’m writing this for the family member who wants to know what their sibling/son/daughter is doing and why it could be one of the best things for them if fostered properly. My goal in writing this is to give in as much detail as I can an understanding of what Tricking is, why it matters, and hopefully give people a different appreciation for it. I hope you enjoy.
