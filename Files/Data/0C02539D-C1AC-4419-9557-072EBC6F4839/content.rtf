\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf4 Everything we understand is in terms of something else. Metaphor is the bridge that links the not yet understood with the already understood. It is metaphor that allows us to generate new models and fit them to concepts we are working to have knowledge of. The stronger the metaphor's we have at our disposal the quicker we will be able to map these things. This is arguably always the case but that's not a debate for now. Many of the things we learn from tricking are essentially metaphorical structures that we can then use to model problems we encounter. Having this robust baseline to reference from allows many complex things to take on a meaning that we can easily make sense of in terms of the things we already know.}
