\pard\plain \fi360\sl288\slmult1\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf4 \tab }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf4 With that understanding lets now take a look at}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf4  Tricking \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93moves\u8221\'94 and the general \u8220\'93move-set\u8221\'94 that had been laid out. We will start broadly and then hone into some of the details to get a picture of this system and how it interacts with itself. Don\u8217\'92t forget to explore the Terms Glossary at the end of this section to get a better understanding of some of these Tricks as we will be moving through these rather quickly. I\u8217\'92ve tried to include some graphics that will help you to visualize the connections these various Tricks have. The goal here is not for you to understand all of tricking terminology but to }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf4 develop}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf4  a basic idea of how things are connected together. We will be going into specifics for each area of terminology in later sections. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf4 In our simple description of Tricking we have said that it is a combination of Kicks, Flips and Twists. We will now break these down a bit further, what do we mean by each of these things? Kicks, often taken from the Martial Arts roots Tricking came out of, refer generally to those actions performed with the legs during a movement. Flips, often taken from Gymnastic Tumbling, and sometimes Breakdancing, refer generally to those actions performed which cause the body to be inverted to some degree. Twists, often taken from all disciplines, generally refers to the rotational quality of an action performed such as a flip or kick. Each move can have one, some, or all of these qualities to them. So in a way our simple description gives a rudimentary sketch of the ways in which each move within Tricking can be made up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf4 Lets learn some of the jargon we commonly use to talk about Tricking. A "}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf4 Trick\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 is a type of \u8220\'93move\u8221\'94 that can be referred to by a name that signifies a series of movements the person will perform in a way that meets the criteria. For instance the }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf4 hook kick}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf4  we learned in one of the previous sections. When someone is Tricking, however, they generally do not perform simply one move, they often perform a combination of movements linked together successively. We refer to these movement chains as a \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93combo\u8221\'94 or sometimes as a \u8220\'93pass\u8221\'94. Each of these individual \u8220\'93Tricks\u8221\'94 (I will often refer to them as \u8220\'93moves\u8221\'94) are linked together with other \u8220\'93}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf4 moves}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf4 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 more specifically called \u8220\'93transitions\u8221\'94. \u8220\'93Transitions\u8221\'94 are a particular type of movement that can bridge between the end state of one \u8220\'93Trick\u8221\'94 to the beginning state of another \u8220\'93Trick\u8221\'94.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf4 Tricks are often built up out of other tricks with one being a base move that give the main structure with other movements added to it. Combining two or more distinct movements into one new movement is called variating and is how new Tricks are most often created. Utilizing the types of tricks we will cover next will allow us to start building an understanding of the entire Tricking framework and how to use it.}}
