\f0\fs24 \cf2 Up to this point we have been looking at things from a very broad and over arching view. In order for us to move forward though, we will have to start exploring some of the more specific elements at play here. Learning some of the Tricking terminology will be necessary for us to make sense of some of the later contents. Each additional piece of detail will enhance the overall maps we have of these things. All of which will allow us a more complete understanding that is less and less an approximation. Every detail refining further; combining with all of the associated attributes and giving clearer boundaries. These amorphous movements start to take form.  \
This is much the way we will encounter these things if we were coming to them as a new tricker. We pick a Trick and drill into it\'92s fundamentals. Learning along the way any associated terminology that may be relevant for us to understand what movements we are actually supposed to be performing. Before we know it, we have developed this very rich vocabulary we can use to discuss and describe many of the pieces of the Trick we are working on acquiring. }
