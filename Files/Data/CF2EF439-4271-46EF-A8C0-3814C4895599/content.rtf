\pard\plain \fi360\sl288\slmult1\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf4 Flow states are much more than just the experience of being happily engaged in a task. They are called flow STATES because we are experiencing an altered state of consciousness. A state of being where we are so absorbed in the task at hand that our full attention gets wrapped up in it. Our action and our awareness of those actions merge and we are no longer paying attention to what our body is doing to enact the action, we are just aware of the action. In the case of me writing this book I will most often lose the attention of my fingers typing on the keyboard to get words on the page. The words are just flowing out of my awareness and onto the page. Flow will often be accompanied by an altered sense of time passing. Sometimes this will make hours feel like seconds, or seconds like minutes. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf4 If you\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92ve ever lost yourself in a conversation with someone before only to look up and realize hours have passed in the blink of an eye, or you\u8217\'92ve ever been so engaged in something that time seemed to slow down, you\u8217\'92ve experienced flow. This idea of losing yourself in the task is often accompanied with a feeling of growth and connection with something bigger than yourself. All of these things coming together to deliver an experiential state of being that is worth trying to access over and over again. A feeling of \u8220\'93aliveness\u8221\'94. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf4 People achieve this altered state of consciousness regularly throughout their lives without realizing it. It is often the thing that we feel that brings us back to some particular hobby or activity, particularly the difficult, or more complex ones. The activities that make us \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93feel alive\u8221\'94 are frequently the ones that get us the deepest into flow.     }}
