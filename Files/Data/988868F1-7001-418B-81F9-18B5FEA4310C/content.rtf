\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0 \tab We spend so much of our lives learning how to label and categorize things into distinct little boxes. Each category an organized set that has things that go in it and things that dont. Each label giving us some word with an associated descrption of what its referring to. We take all these labels and the categories they fit within and use them to build up a model of the world. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 \tab This model we are building is always an approximation. A reference to the way things were "the last time we checked". It contains only the things we have encountered in it. Only the things we thought were necessary to build a sufficient model to move through the world. We do this is because dealing with everything the world has to throw at us at one point would be overwhelming. So we use these models to orient ourselves towards reality in a way that we can map ourselves to it accurately enough.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 \tab In doing so we are constantly throwing out information, reducing and simplifying extremely concept things in the world down to often single words or short phases in order to talk about them. This is extremely useful when we want to have a conversation. Having broad strokes to paint the world with allows us to quickly know which categories we can ignore when we are trying to solve some problem. Which when you reduce it down is fundamentally all we do as humans. We solve problems. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 \tab The issue with this is the fact that we do it so often that its easy for us to forget that these models we have built up about the world are lacking. They are old versions of the way the world was, not the way it is, and is becoming. Reality is an ever changing system that only really "patterns" its processes. Our models are really only close enough for us to make decent predictions. Those predictions becoming more accurate the more often we are making updates to those models and adding new information into the categories and labels we are using. }}
