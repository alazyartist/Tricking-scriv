\f0\fs24 \cf2 	So why do people, in general, think Tricking is just the physical movements taking place. It\'92s easy to think that Tricking is just it\'92s surface level contents. That is the \'93things\'94 or in this case the Tricks or \'93moves\'94 that make it up. I would say primarily because this is often the way it is quickly explained to people. One of two common forms of the \'93standard\'94 definition of Tricking typically given are: 1) Tricking is a combination of kicks, flips, and twists. Or 2) Tricking is a combination of elements from various forms of Martial Arts, Gymnastics Tumbling and Breakdancing. }
